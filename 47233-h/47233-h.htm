<p>As I am obliged to spend the greatest
part of my time in mathematical, philosophical,
and physical studies, it was not my
design to have written on this subject, although
I was advised to do it more than
twelve months ago; but on seeing the movements
in France, on account of the <i>Revolution</i>,
I altered my mind, kept a journal of
many things which I saw and heard, and
have accordingly written the following pages,
which are presented for your perusal and
consideration.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to avoid error, and to
compile the narration as accurate as possible: if
any thing of that kind shall be discovered, I
hope it will be imputed to my being misinformed,
and not to any intention of mine to
impose upon the public.</p>

<p>As it is the duty of every philosopher to
promote the union, harmony, and felicity of
mankind, I have mentioned many things
which I hope may be productive of establishing
the peace and happiness of the inhabitants
of the world. But, alas! it is to
be regretted, that some who have shone
greatly in the philosophical profession, instead
of promoting this laudable work, and for the
sake of ingrossing the riches, honours, and
profits of this perishing world to themselves,
have, under a cloak of religion and liberty,
sowed discord amongst brethren, excited insurrections,
mobs, and riots, which have terminated
in carnage and desolation, and proved
destructive of the public tranquillity, and of
the liberty and happiness of the people. But
these abominable works are by no means the
business of a true philosopher, who will
attempt to do good instead of doing evil.</p>

<p>How far the politicians of the present, or
future ages, may agree with me in sentiment,
time alone must determine. But if the things
that are written in the subsequent sheets
shall prove useful and profitable, it will rejoice
the author.</p>

<p>After wishing your health and prosperity,
and the felicity of mankind through the
world,</p>

<p>
July 7, 1790.<br />
</p>

<p>Having had an inclination to go to Paris for
some months past, I went to Piccadilly this
day, where I engaged a passage on board the stage
coaches, called the diligences, for which I paid five
guineas, and was told "That I would be found for
that sum, with every thing that might be needful
on the way, only I must give about five shillings
to the porters."</p>

<p>At Piccadilly I received a card, a copy of which
I publish for the information of strangers, and
benefit of the owners of the stages.</p>

<p>"The Paris diligences to and from London, set
out from the office next the White Bear Inn, Piccadilly,
every Monday, Thursday, and Saturday,
at five o'clock in the morning. Five guineas each
person, for carriage, sea passage, diet and lodging:
Port fees excepted. Fourteen pounds luggage
allowed; all above to pay three-pence farthing
per pound.</p>

<p>"N. B. In case passengers should be detained by
contrary winds, they are to pay their own expences
from the next day of their arrival at the seaport,
to the time of their shipping.</p>

<p>"Also a wagon, every Monday at ten o'clock in
the morning, to carry goods and merchandize,
which are registered at the said office, and at the
Blossoms Inn, Lawrence-lane, Cheapside, where
declarations must be delivered in writing, and signed
by the owner, of the quality, quantity, and value
of the said merchandize, which will be conveyed
to Paris in the course of a fortnight, at the rate
of seventeen shillings per hundred weight, Custom-house
duties excepted. The proprietors, for the
conveniency of the public, will discharge the said
duties either in England or France, and charge
them with the carriage to the person they are
directed to, without requiring any interest or commission
whatever.</p>

<p>"Attendance at the above offices every day from
nine in the morning till seven in the evening,
where parcels are registered to Paris, and to every
part of France.</p>

<p>"&#8258; Passengers luggage must be sent to the
office between six and seven o'clock in the
evening, or it will be left 'till the following carriage."</p>

<p>As I was on my way to Piccadilly, I was informed
that the king of France was to be crowned
on the fourteenth of this month, and sworn to adhere
to the new Constitution which has been
framed by the National Assembly. This made
me anxious to get to Paris as soon as possible:
but being told the places were all taken in the
coaches, and that it was impossible for me to set
off till the 12th, I was obliged to wait till that
time, but was informed that I must be at Piccadilly
with my trunk, &amp;c. by seven in the evening of the
11th; and I was there at the time; lodged at the
White Bear inn, and at five the next morning set
off for Paris in company with five gentlemen. A
lady in a post-chaise overtook us near Greenwich,
and came into the diligence.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at a good inn on the road, and
dined at Canterbury, where the lady left us, and at
evening reached Dover, where we supped, lodged,
and went to breakfast. About eleven in the
morning of the 13th, we embarked for Calais,
and arrived there in about three hours; but had a
very rough passage, in consequence of which almost
every lady and gentleman on board was
afflicted with sea-sickness, which I believe was advantageous
to the greatest part of us.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Calais a great number of
French gentlemen came to our vessel, to welcome
us to France, and invite us to put up at their
houses; but on finding that some of us belonged
to the diligences, and that there was a place prepared
for our entertainment, they went off disappointed.</p>

<p>Although we had been told that we should
have nothing to pay, only about five shillings to
the porters, we found ourselves mistaken; for we
were obliged to pay for the wine which we drank
when we dined and supped on the preceding day,
and to give money to a swarm of servants, &amp;c.
At Calais we were obliged to give in a list of our
names to the Custom-house officers, and to give
them some money to buy liquor with, that they
might drink our healths&mdash;that being the custom,
as we were told.</p>

<p>We put up at a hotel, called <i>De la Messagrie</i>;
where we left another list of our names; for such
were the orders of the mayor of the city.</p>

<p>An English lady that had come from Dover
with us, and was a decent well-behaved person,
and one of excellent sense and understanding, put
up at this hotel: she told me she had travelled
above 4,000 miles on the European Continent,
had been through France, Germany, &amp;c. and was
then on her way to Flanders.</p>

<p>At this place we were soon beset with a number
of beggars, as</p>

<p>1. By a priest of the order of St. Francis.</p>

<p>2. By the captain of the vessel, that brought us
over the English Channel.</p>

<p>3. By the steward of the vessel.</p>

<p>4. By the sailors that came with us.</p>

<p>5. By the poor of the city.</p>

<p>6. By the porters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We gave the priest some money, and he pronounced
a blessing and departed very well pleased.
I was told that he and his convents got their living
altogether by begging. We gave the captain half
a crown a-piece, and some silver, sous, &amp;c. to the
other beggars.</p>

<p>In a few minutes another swarm of beggars
came that belong to Calais, and as we did not supply
all their wants, some of them broke one of the
windows belonging to the room where we were
sitting, by a rapid stroke with a stick, stone, or
some such thing.</p>

<p>We soon sat down to dinner. The table was
spread in an elegant manner, with napkins laid
in our plates, which we used to keep our clothes
clean.</p>

<p>I was asked, <i>A'imez vous la soupe √† la Fran√ßoise,
Monsieur?</i></p>

<p>My answer was&mdash;<i>Oui, Madame</i>.</p>

<p>Besides soup, we had beef, mutton, veal, rabbits,
hares, geese, fowls, pigeons, &amp;c. several sorts
of pies, excellent wine, and sweet cakes, figs, appricots,
cherries and strawberries; the latter we mixed
with white sugar and wine, and eat the composition
with spoons, which is the French fashion. Their
loaves of bread were about two feet in length, and
six inches in breadth, and their knives had picked
points, and their forks four tines a piece. Every
one of us was allowed a tumbler to drink out of:
but the French do not drink healths, though they
pretended at the Custom-house, that we must give
them money to buy liquor with for that purpose.
We did not pay for our wines in France as we
were on our way to Paris, as we had done at
Dover, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The drinking of healths has been, and still is,
too much practised both in Great Britain and America;
and especially among the lower class of
people. For when Timothy Toss Pot is in company,
he says, "<i>Your healths ladies and gentlemen</i>,"
every time he drinks, which will be perhaps fifty
times in an evening; whereas it might be as well,
nay much better, to drink their healths but once,
or not at all, which would save much trouble, and
prevent the company from being interrupted with
such clamours.</p>

<p>I have asked why the health drinkers do not follow
that practice when they drink tea, or coffee;
as the Irish woman did when she partook of the
sacrament; and have been told, that it is <i>because
it is not the fashion</i>, and that from hence it has
been omitted. The fashion, however, must be
followed, right or wrong; for, Out of the fashion
out of the world, according to the old woman's
scripture: And, When we are among the Romans
we must do as the Romans do. For,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Custom is a living law, whose sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Men more than all the written laws obey."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Says the poet. Because it is customary I have
sometimes been induced to drink healths myself,
when I have been in company, through fear that I
should be called an uncivil and an unpolite person.
But this needless custom is now growing out of
use; for our nobility and gentry have discovered
that it is superfluous, and many of them
have forsaken the needless practice; which example
will undoubtedly be followed by the commonality
in process of time.</p>

<p>We are told in Bailey's Dictionary, that the custom
of drinking healths sprang from Rowena, a
beautiful daughter of Hengistus, general of the
Saxons. The general invited king Vortigern to
supper, and after it was over called for Rowena,
who, richly attired, and with a graceful mein,
enters with a golden bowl full of wine in her hand,
and drinks to the king, saying, "Be of health,
lord king:" to which he replied, "Drink health."
The king enamoured with her beauty, married her,
and gave her and her father all Kent. This was
upwards of 1300 years ago.</p>

<p>We are also told in the Historian's <i>Vade-mecum</i>,
that the custom of drinking healths was in fashion so
early as 1134 years before Christ. The accounts do
not agree, and which is the truest I cannot tell.</p>

<p>Calais is situated in latitude 50 deg. and
58 min. North, and longitude 1 deg.
and 49 min. East from the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich. It is a very pleasant town, invironed
with ramparts thrown up at a vast expence.</p>

<p>At this place we found the people under arms,
and they seemed to be filled with joy in consequence
of the Revolution. We that were strangers, were
obliged to put on and wear National Cockades, to
prevent being insulted by mobs; and no lady or
gentleman was suffered to travel without.</p>

<p>Whilst we tarried at Calais we were informed
that English money would not pass in France, and
that it would be best for us to get our guineas
changed. We therefore took change for some,
and received 26 livres for each guinea, although
an English guinea commonly passes for but 24
livres in France. Hence, about twelve-pence is lost
by the exchange.</p>

<p>Bank notes are not negotiable in France;
therefore those that travel into that country, ought
to take gold and silver, otherwise they will meet
with much difficulty. If you draw on the bankers,
they will charge you eight <i>per cent.</i> discount; but
sometimes it is done at <i>par</i> by French merchants
who want to send money to London. No money
is allowed to pass in France, unless coined in the
present king's reign. Strangers ought therefore to
be upon their guard, lest they get imposed upon
by taking old coin.</p>

<p>They that go to France ought to dress in the
French mode, to prevent being known by sharpers,
who sometimes try to take the advantage of
those they find to be foreigners.</p>

<p>As it may be of some utility to strangers going
into France, I will just add</p>

<p><i>Leaves</i> Calais.&mdash;<i>A Description of the Stage Coaches
in France.&mdash;The</i> <span class="smcap">Doctor</span> <i>arrives at</i> Paris.&mdash;<i>A
further Account of the Beggars.&mdash;With a Description
of the Country.</i></p></div>


<p>Early in the morning of the memorable 14th
of July we left Calais, and proceeded in a stage
coach, drawn by eight horses, on our journey towards
Paris.</p>

<p>These coaches are almost as large as a small
house. They are very heavy; and eight persons
may sit comfortably in the inside, and I believe a
dozen more upon the outside. We had a conductor
who rode armed on the fore-part of this
wonderful machine, and a very large dog sitting
upon his rump at the conductor's left hand; both
of which were employed as sentinals to guard us
on the way.</p>

<p>The harnesses for the horses were made of ropes
instead of leather, and were very long. Hence,
as our coach was very large and the traces very
long, we made a grand appearance as we travelled!</p>

<p>Upon the hindmost and foremost horses, on the
near side, two Frenchmen were mounted, with
boots of a most surprizing magnitude, so well constructed
with leather, wood, and iron, that if a
horse falls down the rider is not in much danger
of having his legs broke; for the prevention of
which, the boots were thus made.</p>

<p>The horses were not quite so large as ours in
England; but we drove about five or six miles in
an hour, and at the end of every post the horses
and postillions were changed. The postillions
received twelve sous of us when we parted with
them, which gave content.</p>

<p>We breakfasted at Boulogne, dined at Montreul,
and in the evening came to Abbeville, where we
lodged. The people were in arms through the
country. Scarce any body was at work in the
fields, as it was a time of feasting, and all seemed
rejoiced at the sound of the liberty they expect,
in consequence of the great and glorious Revolution.</p>

<p>At this place there was a young lady, who manifested
by her actions, which speak louder than
words, that she had an inclination to lodge with
me that night; but as I had no disposition to deal
in such commodities, she was disappointed.</p>

<p>The next morning we set out early, breakfasted
at Amiens, dined at the Breteuil, supped at Clermont,
and rode all night; but were obliged to pay
for our breakfasts out of our own pockets the
next morning before we came to Paris. We arrived
at Paris about nine in the morning, being
the 16th of July, having been four days and four
hours on our journey. We were abliged to give
the conductor half a crown a-piece; and I spent
near three guineas on the way, besides what I
paid at Piccadilly.</p>

<p>At Paris we had our trunks searched at the Custom-house,
and went from thence in a coach to
the <i>Hotel de Beauvais, Rue des Vieux Augustins, No.
69, Quartier du Palais Royal</i>, where a gentleman
that had come from London with me, and myself,
hired three large rooms, neatly furnished, for four
livres a-day. We breakfasted at this place, which
cost us fifteen sous a-piece each morning, besides
what we gave to the servants.</p>

<p>I hired a servant, who remained with me all the
time I tarried at Paris: he charged me forty sous
per day; but he conducted me so well, that I gave
him more than double that sum.</p>

<p>I found Paris very full of people from the country,
and from foreign parts. They had met to celebrate
the Revolution, and tarried till the next Sunday
in order to have another grand convention at
the <i>Champ de Mars</i>.</p>

<p>Whilst we were on our way from Calais to
Paris, we were followed, in some of the intermediate
towns and villiages, by swarms of beggars, who
seemed to be in great distress. I asked the reason
of their begging; and was told that they were reduced
to poverty in consequence of the commercial
treaty between England and France; that
the manufactories in Great Britain were so much
cheaper than they were in France, that the merchants
bought many of their goods in England,
which had thrown those poor people out of employ,
and obliged them to beg for a livelihood.</p>

<p>We frequently contributed to the relief of those
distressed objects: but because we could not give
to every one, some of them threw a stone at our
coach, which did not happen to strike any of us.
At, and near Paris, we found but a few beggars,
in proportion to the great number of people.
Some how or another, they seemed to be much better
provided for than they were in the country.</p>

<p>The face of the country between Calais and
Paris, appears much like many parts of the Province
of Quebec, in America. But I think the
soil is not quite so rich. Though some have supposed
it is full as good by nature as the island of
Great Britain; and that it would produce as large
crops, if it was as well manured and cultivated. I
was told, that agriculture had been much discouraged
in France, before the Revolution, by
reason of the oppression that the peasants were
under.</p>

<p>More then three-fourths of the land between
Calais and Paris, appeared to be overspread with
grain, consisting of rye, wheat, oats, and barley.
There was also some excellent hemp and flax. The
people had begun to reap, and there was a sign of a
very plentiful harvest; but the crops were not so
large in general as they are in England. We saw
but a very few cattle, horses and sheep, and those
we did see were small. The fields are not fenced,
but lie open to the high-way. We often passed by
boys holding cows to feed, by lines tied round
their horns, to keep them from running into the
fields. The wages for reaping are, generally,
thirty sous per day. Both men and women follow
the business, begin early, and lie down on the
ground, and sleep in the open sunshine, at about
ten or eleven in the morning; a practice which I
esteem to be unhealthy. Perhaps one may see fifty
asleep at a time.</p>

<p><i>Views and Describes the</i> Champ de Mars.&mdash;<i>Goes to
the Royal Palace belonging to the Duke of Orleans.&mdash;Dines
with the French Officers at the Grand Hotel.</i></p></div>


<p>On the day of our arrival at Paris, I went in a
coach with the gentleman that had put up at
the hotel with me, and viewed the <i>Champ de Mars</i>.
Here we saw great multitudes of people, eating,
drinking, and dancing at the sound of the bands of
music. At this place the oaths of allegiance had
been administered to the people on the preceding
Wednesday; and both the king and the subjects
were sworn to adhere to the constitution that has
been framed by the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Some of the French took me by the hand when
I entered into the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, and cried,
"Entr√©e, entr√©e, Monsieur." I viewed the place
with admiration, and was informed that it took
about fifty thousand people near ten days to erect
the seats and other great works there.</p>

<p>The <i>Champ de Mars</i> was formed into a grand
amphitheatre, having at one end the military
school, against which was erected a covered gallery
two hundred and twenty-eight feet (French measure)
in length, and twenty-one in heighth, for
the king, queen, foreign ambassadors, national
assembly, &amp;c. &amp;c. and at the other the triumphal
arch; from which, to the military school, on either
side were thirty rows of seats raised one above
another, two thousand seven hundred and ninety
French feet in length. In the middle of the area
was an altar in a circular form, whose circumference
was six hundred and forty-eight feet, French
measure, and whose heighth was twenty feet,
built of stone taken from the Bastille. The rest of
the area, except the places for the federation, was
filled with seats; the whole forming an oblong, capable
of accommodating between four and five hundred
thousand people. Out of these limits were a
number of galleries, erected for a great multitude
of spectators. Opposite the triumphal arch, a
bridge of boats was thrown across the Seine,
and the banks of the river was lined with cannon.</p>

<p>For a great distance round the <i>Champ de Mars</i>,
a number of temporary buildings were erected for
the entertainment of the people.</p>

<p>When we had surveyed these admirable works,
we went to the royal palace, which was built by
cardinal Richelieu, and given by him to Lewis
the XIV. but is now the town seat of the duke of
Orleans, who is a nobleman of royal blood, and
enjoys the greatest revenue in France. This
palace is a most elegant and magnificent structure,
which is adorned and beautified with splendid ornaments,
that dazzle the eyes of a spectator. In
the centre of this structure is an oblong square,
laid out in beautiful walks, interspersed with trees,
flowers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sometimes the duke resides in one part of the
palace himself. But the other part is let out in
shops, which are under piazzas, and the rooms
over them to gay fashionable ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>In this palace there is a gallery, which contains
most of the illustrious personages that France has
produced, drawn by the greatest masters: Italy
has been ransacked, and no expence spared to
make the whole complete, with pictures, busts,
statues, medals, and other curiosities worthy of
being collected. It is thought that this building
exceeds all in Europe for beauty and grandeur.</p>

<p>After we had viewed the palace we went to a
grand hotel, where we dined with a great number
of officers. We had a variety of dishes, very excellent
wines, and was entertained with much
civility and politeness, and at a very reasonable
rate. At evening we retired to our lodgings,
very well pleased with the entertainments of the
day.</p>

<p><i>The Contents of the King's Proclamation.&mdash;Of the
Obedience paid to it&mdash;and, the Proceedings of the
Grand Confederation, on the 14th of July, at the</i>
Champ de Mars.</p></div>


<p>Having in the preceding chapter given a
description of the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, I shall
attempt in this to exhibit how matters were conducted
on the 14th: but it may be proper to premise,
that on the 11th, the king, to prevent confusion
and disorder, wisely issued a proclamation,
setting forth how the different corps that were to
compose the confederation was to march, &amp;c.
His majesty ordered that no troops, but those on
guard, should be armed with guns; nor any carriages
suffered to follow those of his majesty, the
royal family, and their trains. That if any deputy
of the confederation, or person invited, should
be unable to walk, they might ride in a carriage,
and be escorted by a <i>Chevalier d'Ordonnance</i> to
the military school, providing they had permission
from the mayor of Paris.</p>

<p>That M. de la Fayette should be commander-general
of the Parisian national guard, then
charged by a decree of the national assembly, and
sanctioned by his majesty, with the care of the
public tranquillity, should fulfil, under the king's
orders, the functions of major-general of the confederation;
and in that quality the orders should
be given and observed as the orders of his majesty
himself.</p>

<p>That the king had in like manner nominated M.
Gouvion, major-general of the Parisian guard,
lieutenant-general of the confederation for the day
of the ceremony.</p>

<p>That when all persons were placed, the blessing
the flags and colours should be proceeded to, and
the celebration of the mass.</p>

<p>That the king empowered the said M. de la
Fayette, to pronounce the confederation oath in
the name of all the deputies of the national guards,
and those of the troops and marines, according to
the forms decreed by the national assembly, and
accepted by his majesty; and that all the deputies
of the confederation should hold up their hands.</p>

<p>That then the president of the national assembly
should pronounce the civic oath for the members of
the national assembly; and that the king should in
like manner pronounce the oath, the form of
which had been decreed by the national assembly,
and accepted by his majesty.</p>

<p>That the <i>Te Deum</i> should be sung, and conclude
the ceremony; after which the procession should
return from the <i>Champ de Mars</i> in the same order
it came.</p>

<p>In obedience to this proclamation, an order of
procession was drawn up, and proper measures concerted
to prevent tumult and disorder, by M. de la
Fayette, and M. Bailli, the mayor of Paris.</p>

<p>On the 13th, at ten o'clock in the evening, 4000
Paris guards on the outside of the <i>Champ de Mars</i>,
and 2000 within, were placed to preserve order.
Before eleven the people began to assemble and seat
themselves and came in small parties till day-break;
from three to nine they poured in in crowds at
the great avenues, where the guards cautioned
them not to hurry.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the seats were filled, the outside
gallaries, the windows, and roofs of houses; and
every place where a glimpse of the grand procession
could be had, was filled with people of all
ranks, sexes, and ages, who kept their places till
the business was finished, notwithstanding the rain
fell in torrents, accompanied with cold squalls of
wind from eight till four.</p>

<p>Those guards that were not wanted in the procession,
danced in circles, and in great parties marched
triumphantly at the beat of the drums, with
their hats and caps on the points of their swords,
forming battalions, and making sham fights, &amp;c.
Sometimes they ran in all directions, flourishing
their swords, and being filled with joy cried, "<i>Vive
la Libertie! Vive la Loi! Vive la Roi! Vive la Confederation
National! Vive mon Frere!</i>"&mdash;embracing one
another, and the spectators that sat near them.</p>

<p>One, personating a victim of tyranny, was carried
with great solemnity to a market spot, where the
body was laid, and made the occasion of more
firmly uniting, which was testified with a variety of
actions.</p>

<p>Having an abb√© within the circle, they marched
him round with a gun in his hand and a grenadier's
cap on his head; and in the same manner they
marched a capuchin friar.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock a crucifix was placed on the
great altar.</p>

<p>Just before nine a body of priests appeared on
the altar, and tied sashes of national colours
around their waists, and decorated the crucifix, and
various parts of the altar, with ribbons of the
same.</p>

<p>At half past ten the bishop of Auton, with more
than one hundred priests, proceeded in a double
line, guarded by a strong body of national troops,
from the grand pavilion to the altar, carrying with
them the tables with the commandments, and the
sacred books. When they had ascended the altar
they began the ceremony of consecrating it.</p>

<p>Just before twelve, a grand salute of one hundred
cannon announced the near approach of the procession
to the triumphal arch; and the guards
formed into ranks for their reception.</p>

<p>The national federatives, and all who assisted in
the grand procession, had assembled at six this
morning on the Boulevards, between the gates of
St. Martin and St. Antoine, and were drawn up in
the following order:</p>

<p>1. A troop of horse, with standards, and six
trumpets.</p>

<p>2. One division of music, consisting of several
hundred instruments.</p>

<p>3. A company of grenadiers.</p>

<p>4. The electors of the city of Paris.</p>

<p>5. A company of volunteers.</p>

<p>6. The assembly of the representatives of the
commons.</p>

<p>7. The military committee.</p>

<p>8. A company of chasseurs.</p>

<p>9. A band of drums.</p>

<p>10. The presidents of the districts.</p>

<p>11. The deputies of the commons, appointed to
take for them the federal oath.</p>

<p>12. The sixty administrators of the municipality,
with the city guards.</p>

<p>13. The second division of music.</p>

<p>14. A battalion of children, pupils of the military
school, carrying a standard with the words,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The hopes of the nation."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>15. A detachment of the colours of the national
guard of Paris.</p>

<p>16. A battalion of veterans.</p>

<p>17. The deputies of forty-two chief departments
of the nation, in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>18. The <i>oriflamme</i>, or grand standard of France,
borne by the marischalls of France, general officers,
officers of the staff, subaltern officers, commissioners
of war, invalids.</p>

<p>19. The lieutenants of the marischalls of
France,&mdash;deputies of infantry,&mdash;deputies of cavalry.</p>

<p>20. Deputies of hussars, dragoons, and chasseurs.</p>

<p>21. General officers, and deputies of the marine,
according to rank.</p>

<p>22. The deputies of forty-one last departments,
in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>23. A company of volunteer chasseurs.</p>

<p>24. A company of cavalry, with a standard and
two trumpets.</p>

<p>Each department was preceded by a banner,
borne by the oldest deputy. These banners were
a present from the city of Paris. They consisted
of two branches, forming an oak wreath, tied
together with national coloured ribbons, bearing
on one side&mdash;<i>The National Confederation at
Paris, July 14, 1790</i>; and the other&mdash;<i>The Constitution</i>,
with the number and device of the department
to which they severally belong.</p>

<p>The military deputies had only their side arms.</p>

<p>At nine the procession passed along the streets of
St. Denis, of the Forronerie, to St. Honor√© Royal,
to the palace of Louis XV. where they halted; and
the detachment of the colours of the national
guard Paris opening to the right and left,
received into the centre.</p>

<p>The procession then moved on through the <i>Cours
la Reine</i>, along the quay to the bridge of boats; and
the deputies from the provinces received loud acclamations
of applause from the people, which
were answered by <i>Vivent lis Parisians!</i></p>

<p>At the end of the bridge the triumphal arch appeared,
adorned with various allegorical paintings
which represented the gate of St. Antoine.</p>

<p>Over the principal entrance, referring to figures
that were darting through all the obstacles to reach
the law, was inscribed on the side:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sacred to the grand work of the constitution: We will
finish it."</p></div>

<p>On the other:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Under this defender, the poor man shall no more fear lest
the oppressor should spoil him of his heritage."</p></div>

<p>Over the lateral entrance on the left side, figures
of warriors taking the civic oath, seemed to utter,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our country, or the law alone can arm us: Let us die to
defend it, let us live to love it."</p></div>

<p>Over the lateral entrance, on the right, heralds
sounding trumpets, proclaimed peace throughout
the kingdom, and the people were singing,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Every thing is propitious to our happiness; every thing
flatters our wishes; sweet peace drives tumult far from us,
and fills up the measure of our pleasures."</p></div>

<p>On the front, next the amphitheatre, over the
middle arch, was a picture of deputies from various
nations, come to do homage to the national assembly,
with this inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The rights of men were unknown for ages: They have
been re-established for the whole human race."</p></div>

<p>Under this picture,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The king of a free people is alone a powerful king."</p></div>

<p>Over a picture&mdash;a woman chaining lions to her
ear, with Force and Power in her suite, and leaning
on the book of the law. The king and queen
holding the dauphin by the hand, follow, preceded
by a group of sages. A combat is exhibited
with a dreadful hydra, whose head was seen
struck off.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We dread you no more, ye subordinate tyrants, who oppressed
us under a hundred various names."</p></div>

<p>In another place an immense multitude listening
with attention to the sage exhortations of a victorious
warrior, who seemed to say,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You prize this liberty, you possess it while you do: Shew
yourselves worthy to preserve it."</p></div>

<p>At one o'clock the van of the procession appeared
under this triumphal arch.</p>

<p>M. de la Fayette leading a body of cavalry, himself
mounted on a milk white charger, rode into
the amphitheatre amid the acclamations of the
people, <i>Vive la Fayette!</i> The cavalry filed off to
the right, and ranged themselves in the exterior
line, on the opposite side to the entrance. The
company of grenadiers formed under the steps of
the amphitheatre, as well as all the companies who
were employed as escorts.</p>

<p>The civil bodies took the places allotted for
them, which was previously marked out. The
battalion of youths of the military school,
formed about one hundred paces from the grand
altar, crossing the <i>Champ de Mars</i>; but facing the
altar on the side next the military school.</p>

<p>While the national assembly passed through
the triumphal arch, the escort of colours passed
through the lateral gates, and the members took
their seats on the right and left of the chair of
state, and the chair of their own president.</p>

<p>The battalion of veterans was placed a hundred
paces behind the altar, across the <i>Champ de Mars</i>,
but facing the altar.</p>

<p>The detachments of the national guards, appointed
to take the oath, ranged themselves under
each banner, indicative of his place in the amphitheatre.</p>

<p>The music collected into one band, and occupied
the side of the platform under the altar, next
to the invalids; and the band of drums were placed
on the opposite side.</p>

<p>The detachment of cavalry that closed the procession,
formed the exterior line, on the side where
they entered, opposite to the first detachment.</p>

<p>The altar was after an antique model. The
ascent to it was by four stair cases; at each corner
was a platform supporting an urn, which exhaled
perfumes. On the south front were these verses
from Mahomet, under a picture of arts and
sciences:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Les mortals sont egaux, ce ne'st pas leur naissance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"C'est la seule vertu qui fait leur difference."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Men are equal: it is not by birth. It is virtue alone that
confers distinction."</p></div>

<p>And these,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"La loi dans tout doit etre universelle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Le mortels quels qu'ils soient egaux devant elle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The law in all things ought to be universal: Men of all
descriptions are equal in its eyes."</p></div>

<p>On the opposite side were four angels sounding
trumpets, with this inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Hold in your remembrance these sacred words, which are
the guarantee of your decrees;&mdash;The nation, the law, and
the king. The nation is yourselves&mdash;the law is your own,
for it is your will&mdash;and the king is the guardian of the law."</p></div>

<p>On the front, next to the Seine, was the figure
of Liberty, dispersing the surrounding clouds, with
attributes of Agriculture, and Abundance; and the
Genius of France hovering in the air, and pointing
to the word <i>Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>On the front, facing the throne, were warriors
pronouncing the federal oath, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"We swear to remain ever faithful to the <i>nation</i>, the <i>law</i>,
and the <i>king</i>: to maintain, with all our power, the constitution
decreed by the national assembly, and accepted by the king:
to protect, according to the law, the surety of persons and property,
the circulation of corn and provisions within the realm,
the levying of public contributions, under whatever form they
may exist; and to continue united to all the French by the
indissoluble ties of brotherhood."</p></div>

<p>At three the signal was made for conducting the
<i>oriflamme</i>, or sacred royal standard, with the banners
of the eighty-three departments, to the altar
to receive the benediction.</p>

<p>Upon the same signal the queen, (with her attendants)
made her appearance in a partitioned place
immediately behind the king's chair, having the
dauphin with her, whom she placed on her knee:
she was well received, and the dauphin much applauded.
She was most becomingly dressed; her
cap decorated with pearls, a pearl necklace, and
pearl ear-rings.</p>

<p>As soon as she was seated, the king entered
and took his chair of state, which was fixed upon a
line with a lesser chair, upon which the president of
the national assembly sat. From the top of the king's
state chair, the crown had been removed, and the
cap of liberty substituted in its place. He was superbly
dressed in a rich suit of gold tissue, and appeared
to be in good spirits. He directed his conversation
to the president, and it drew forth continual
bursts of applause.</p>

<p>At forty minutes after three the conclusion of the
ceremony of consecrating the banners was announced,
by a heavy discharge of the artillery, and
the sound of martial music.</p>

<p>The banners having rejoined their several stations,
the great body of the national guards, who
hitherto had lined the extreme of the inner circle,
now formed on each side a half circle, from the
foot of the pavilion steps to the altar; the ensigns
of each of the sixty of Paris districts, all of which
were extremely beautiful, and various in their
devices, being marched first up to the front of the
pavilion, and saluting as they passed it.</p>

<p>The bishop of Autun, as grand Almoner, assisted
by sixty deputy Almoners, elected by sixty districts
of Paris, then celebrated mass, to the sound of the
musical instruments.</p>

<p>Some delay took place in the expectation that
the king would advance to the altar, and there
take the civic oath. But his majesty remained on
the throne.</p>

<p>M. de la Fayette then gave the signal for the national
deputies to come forward and take the oath.
He ascended the altar; and on the sound of the
trumpet, extending his right hand, and looking
steadfastly at the altar while the oath was reading,
pronounced the words,&mdash;"I swear it." Which
the national guards all repeated after him, turning
round their hats on the points of their bayonets.</p>

<p>The discharge of a bomb was the signal.</p>

<p>Mons. Bonnay, the president of the national
assembly, next rose from his seat, and advancing
to the front of the covered gallery, in which
the members of the national assembly and the
civil bodies were seated, fixed his eyes on the altar,
extended his right arm, and as the oath was repeating,
pronounced with great dignity, "I swear
it:" followed in like manner by the legislative,
and the deputies of the civil and municipal bodies.</p>

<p>At forty-five minutes past four the king rose;
and, waiting till every thing was silent, read very
audibly, and with an excellent majesty of manner,
the <span class="smcap">OATH</span><sup>[1] </sup>assigned to him; extended his arm,
looked steadfastly at the altar, and pronunced, "I
swear it."</p>

<p class="center">Footnote 1: "I swear to be faithful to the Nation, the Law, and the
King, and to maintain the Constitution to the utmost of my
power, as decreed by the National Assembly, and confirmed
by the King."</p>

<p>The acclamations of the people, shouting "<i>Long
live</i> <span class="smcap">Louis</span>, <i>our Country, and Constitution!</i>"&mdash;the
clattering of sixty thousand swords, the waving of
one hundred and forty-three banners and ensigns,
and the discharge of an immense line of artillery,
excited feelings which words cannot express, and
which the human imagination, unaided by a view
of the grand and glorious scene, can form no adequate
conception of. The awful and unbroken stillness
maintained during the administration of the
oaths, rendered the acclamations which followed
more forcible than they would otherwise have
been.</p>

<p><i>Te Deum</i> was then sung by a choir of more
than three hundred voices, accompanied by three
hundred drums, and all the military musical instruments.</p>

<p>The ceremony being over, the king went away
almost immediately.</p>

<p>The procession moved off in the order in which
it entered.</p>

<p>The people walked home as they came, without
crowding; and in little more than an hour the place
was cleared.</p>

<p>A repast for the deputies was served up at the
<i>Chateau de la Muette</i>. Each battalion of Parisian
guards undertook to be entertainers of their provincial
brethren, who all partook of the repast
with the utmost order.</p>

<p>Thirty thousand persons dined in the gardens,
and wine and provisions were distributed to more
than one hundred thousand. The people were
so temperate, that I cannot learn that any of the
troops were seen at night reeling about the streets,
in a state of intoxication.</p>

<p>The day concluded with dances in all places
near the <i>Champ de Mars</i>. In the evening a superb
fire-work was exhibited in the square of the <i>Hotel de
Ville</i>; and at night there was a general illumination.</p>

<p>This is the most accurate account that I have
been able to obtain of the proceedings of the king
and the people.</p>

<p>As it is thought there were more people collected
together upon this occasion then ever met
at one time and place in the world, and as some
people are desirous of having a particular description
of the transactions of the day; it is hoped the
reader will excuse the author for being more than
usually copious in the incidents treated of throughout
this chapter.</p>

</p>

<p>This morning the gentleman who had put
up at the hotel with me, asked if I had any
letters of recommendation from any gentlemen in
London, to any in Paris? I told him I had not:
that I had had the offer of some, but for the want
of time did not go to receive them: That as I
could not tarry long, and had money enough to
bear my expences, I believed that <i>that</i> would
be recommendation enough, if I behaved well. I
had though, by the way, a general recommendation
from some gentlemen of my acquaintance,
but it was not directed to any body in particular
in Paris; and I also had a diploma in my pocket,
which was a sufficient recommendation, in any
quarter of the globe; but I did not let the inquirer
know I had any such thing with me. He
seemed to think I would cut but a poor figure
without recommendations; but as it happened I
had no need of shewing any&mdash;though I would not
advise any gentleman or lady to travel without;
because a recommendation may be of great service
sometimes, and especially in a time of war.</p>

<p>At about nine this morning, I was visited by
M. Iberti, <i>Docteur en M√©decine</i>, and physician to
the Court of Spain. He informed me that he had
heard that an English physician had arrived, and
that he was come to tell me, that if he could be
of any service to me any way, he should be happy
in doing of it. I thanked him for his kindness,
and told him that I wanted to get an account of
the practice of the hospitals, and with that an account
of the operation of medicines in France:</p>

<p>That for more than sixteen years I had been
preparing for publication, a New Dispensatory,
which will contain;</p>

<p>1. The <i>meteria medica</i>.</p>

<p>2. The operation of medicines.</p>

<p>3. The art and science of pharmacy.</p>

<p>4. The composition of medicines.</p>

<p>5. An index of diseases, and their remedies;
with,</p>

<p>6. The manual operations and remedies used
in surgery.</p>

<p>That the work would be adorned with cuts of
the chymical and surgical instruments, and also
with chymical characters and botanical figures:</p>

<p>That I had travelled in Great Britain and America,
to obtain knowledge; and was come to Paris
for the same purpose.&mdash;</p>

<p>Said he, I am employed by the court of Spain
on the same business, and have travelled through
England, Scotland, and Ireland; and am come
here to collect all the knowledge I possibly
can. He gave me a description of the state and
condition of the hospitals in Paris; and told me
where I could obtain the publications I wanted,
which are entirely new, and had not reached
London. He also advised me to view the hospitals,
and to go to Cherenton and see the anatomical
productions there, which he said exceeded
every thing of the kind in the world.</p>

<p>He visited me three times, and brought a
French physician to see me once.</p>

<p>I visited M. Iberti once, and he gave me a
book he had published, entitled, <i>Observations Generales
sur les Hopitauz; suivies d'un Projeett d'Hospital</i>.
In consequence of which the Royal Academy
of Arts and Sciences at Paris had honoured
him with a <i>medal</i>, in token that his works were
highly applauded. He also told me that he had
the use of the king's library.</p>

<p>I told him that I would endeavour to make
him a present of a New Dispensatory, if he would
let me know where I could send one that would
get to him: he thanked me, and desired I would
send one to the Spanish Ambassador in Great
Britain, with whom he said he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>The Spanish physician's advice did me infinite
service: I followed his direction, and obtained
what I went after.</p>

<p>Among the many curiosities that I viewed this
day was the ground where the Bastille stood, which
had been a horrible place of punishment for about
400 years. I found this prison almost demolished,
though a few of the dungeons remained: but
the people were taking down the arches, walls,
&amp;c. An amazing quantity of stone had been
carried from this disagreeable prison, and piled
up in a street that environs the city, besides those
at the <i>Champ de Mars</i>.</p>

<p>Before this prison was demolished it was surrounded
by a ditch, and had no entrance to it
but by a draw-bridge.</p>

<p>On the 6th of July, 1789, the National Assembly
having established a committee of finances,
which consisted of 64 members, and appointed
M. Necker, president; the king afterwards
appointed Baron de Breteuil, president, in the
room of M. Necker; and having removed several
other officers, the indignation of the populace
was raised, who armed themselves, and were
joined by the French guards. A slight skirmish ensued
in the <i>Place de Louis XV.</i> in which two was
killed, and two wounded, which belonged to the
Duc de Choiseu's regiment of dragoons.</p>

<p>On the 8th the populace forced the convent
of St. Lazare, in which was found a quantity
of corn, arms, ammunition, &amp;c. A general consternation
prevailed; the shops were shut, and
business was at a stand.</p>

<p>On the 14th the hospital of invalids surrendered
to about 20,000 citizens, headed by the
French guards: About 4,000 troops, 52,000
stands of arms, besides cannon, ammunition, &amp;c.
were taken. In the evening about 10 or 12,000
men, with two pieces of cannon, demanded
the ammunition deposited in the Bastille. The
governor held out a white flag, and opened one
of the gates, through which about forty citizens
and soldiers entered: he immediately drew up the
bridge, and his troops massacred those that had
entered. This breach of faith enraged the populace:
a battle ensued, and the Bastille was
taken in about three hours. The governor, the
jailor, chief gunner, and two others were carried
prisoners to the Hotel de Ville, where they were
tried and executed, by being shot, and afterwards
beheaded. M. de Flesselles, the first municipal
officer of Paris, underwent the same fate, on
being suspected of betraying the citizens. Their
heads were carried in triumph through the streets
of the city. In taking the Bastille about 300
were killed, besides those the governor massacred.
The prisoners were liberated; and an old
man, who had been in a dungeon thirty years,
fell down when he came out, by reason of the
operation the light had upon him.</p>

<p>Those that took the Bastille are honoured with
a particular mark in their apparel, to distinguish
them from other people.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Paris, July 18.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This morning, being Sunday, I sent my servant
for a coach to carry me to the <i>Champ
de Mars</i>; but he returned without any, with this
intelligence from the coachman, <i>viz.</i> that they
were all forbid to move a coach that day, by
reason of the great multitude of people that
was to convene; as it was supposed, that many
would be crushed to death if they were allowed
to ride in coaches. The nobility, gentry, and
commonalty, were therefore all obliged to walk
to the <i>Champ de Mars</i>; at which place I took a
seat, a little to the left of the National Assembly,
where I had a fine prospect. There was the greatest
multitude of people collected that I ever saw
at one time, and they behaved with decency and
good order. The Marquis de la Fayette rode
at the head of the army, and was frequently
honoured with huzzas, loud acclamations, and
other demonstrations of joy. Among the bands
of music was a very large drum, that seemed to
make the earth tremble when it was beat.</p>

<p>I took a seat about ten, and tarried about five
hours. About half past one, an air balloon, of a
large magnitude, ascended to the southward of
the <i>Champ de Mars</i>. It was conducted by a
great number of men, who held its lines, over
the place where I was sitting. It descended on
our heads, and the French cried, <i>En bas, en bas,
Monsieur</i>: Down, down, Sir. I bowed myself almost
to the ground, to prevent being hurt; but
arose, and pushed the balloon upwards with my
hand: It ascended, and went to the northward;
but descended again several times, and afterwards
passed to the southward by the National Assembly,
almost in a horizontal direction. When it
had got at a little distance from the <i>Champ de
Mars</i>, the inflammable air took fire, and the balloon
split, with a report something like that of a cannon.
It was said that several persons were considerably
burnt when the balloon burst. I understood
the next day, that some of the French
supposed, that a great blessing will follow those
upon whom the balloon descended.</p>

<p>After I had left the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, I dined
at a grand hotel, where thirty-two tables were
spread in one room. At this place a French
lady viewed me with an <i>amorous eye</i>; and
I perceived by some of her <i>motions</i>, after I had
dined, that she had an inclination to <i>lead me into
temptation</i>: but I was soon off with myself, and
was thereby <i>delivered from evil</i>.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to the <i>Italian opera</i>, where
sixty-two persons appeared on the stage at the first
view. The vocal and instrumental music was excellent,
and the other performances very entertaining.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Paris, July 19.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This morning I viewed the grand hospital,
the lying-in hospital, the foundling hospital,
and the greatest cathedral in the kingdom,
called <i>L'Eglise de Notre Dame</i>. It is a grand Gothic
structure, has a very fine choir, altar, &amp;c.
and many paintings, some of which represent the
miracles and resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p>There were 17,500 children belonging to the
foundling hospital, above 7,000 of which had
been taken in within the compass of a year.
They were kept very clean, and I did not hear a
child cry amongst the whole number.</p>

<p>The matron, or governess of the hospital,
shewed me their grand stores of linen and garments
for the children, which was worth beholding.</p>

<p>This hospital is a most excellent institution:
People of all kinds, and from all countries, are allowed
to bring their children into it; and no
questions are asked; only the person that leaves
the child is asked if the child has been christened.
If that has not been done, they get it
done at the hospital. Those that bring their
children put a ribbon round their necks, or
mark them with something whereby they may
be known in some future time, and they are permitted
to take them away when they please.</p>

<p>Those that remain in the hospitals, are put out
to learn trades, when they are old enough;&mdash;and
sums of money are given to those who take them.</p>

<p>I was told that a young woman from
Great Britain had just lain in at the lying-in
hospital, and had put her child into the foundling
hospital. Perhaps she may pass for a <i>virgin</i>
again, on her arrival in England!</p>

<p>This hospital must be of great utility to the people,
because it relieves the poor, and prevents
murder; as women have not the temptation to kill
their children through fear of not having them supported;
and also, because it produces a great
number of good members of society.</p>

<p>After I had viewed the hospitals, I made a purchase
of two books, which contained all I was in
pursuit after. I also viewed the house where Voltaire
the famous French poet died.</p>

<p>The same day I went in a coach with my servant
to Versailles, which is about twelve miles
from Paris. We arrived there about noon; and
I viewed the king and queen's palaces, which
are said to be the richest in the world, or at least,
the most beautiful and magnificent in Europe. I
also viewed the royal chapel and two of the royal
theatres, and the king's gardens planted with tropical
and other trees, plants, and herbs. The
buildings are adorned and beautified with gold,
and many splendid ornaments, and there are a
great number of statues, and elegant paintings;
all of which afford a very beautiful prospect.</p>

<p>Versailles is a pleasant place, and there are
about 60,000 inhabitants in the town. I dined
after I had viewed the curiosities, and returned
to Paris in the evening, where I saw the Dauphin
of France, attended by a monk.</p>

<p>Versailles is said to be the dearest place for entertainment
that there is in France, owing to the
great number of nobility and gentry that resort
there: Therefore ought every traveller to be well
provided with money when he goes to see that
place.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Paris, July 20.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This day I viewed the charity hospital, and
the hospital for invalids. The latter is a
large and elegant building, in which there is a
chapel, that is said to cover as much ground as
the cathedral of St. Paul's, in London. The floors
of the domes are made of fine marble, and each
dome is dedicated to some saint, whose statue is
placed in a niche, or hallow. There are some of
the finest paintings in this chapel that I ever saw;
and the hospital commonly contains about 200
officers, and 3,000 soldiers.</p>

<p>Afterwards I viewed the house of Bourbonne,
and the royal observatory, where <i>astronomical observations</i>
are taken. I looked through the telescopes,
and surveyed the mathematical instruments.
I saw an account of the late observations, and perceived
that the French are very accurate in performances
of that kind: but I did not give them
to understand that I was a professor of the science.</p>

<p>I also viewed a great church, called <i>Jamies</i>,
which has been near twenty years in building, and
is not yet wholly finished. In this church there
are some of the largest and finest pillars that I
ever beheld.</p>

<p>Afterwards I took a survey of the buildings
and gardens which belong to the king's eldest
brother; and went to the French theatre and saw
the grand performances there. After the play
was over, on returning to my lodgings, I was
seized on the way by a very gay young lady,
who accosted me with&mdash;<i>J' aime vous, Monsieur.&mdash;Voulez
vous venir avec moi?</i>&mdash;My answer was in
the negative. I was obliged to break her hold,
and be off with myself. "Perhaps, said I, if I go
with you, I may be robbed and murdered: it is
best for me to keep out of the fire whilst it is in
my power."</p>

<p>I had heard but a few days before of a man that
was so simple as to accept of the invitation of
two lewd women, who took him to their lodgings;
but before morning he was robbed, not
only of his watch and money, but of his clothes,
and turned out naked into the street by some
whore-mongers that frequented the house. This
shews how dangerous it is to venture one's-self
amongst strangers, and especially those of this sort.
It is safest for every one, either at home or
abroad, to shun all such kind of company, as well
as the company of thieves, drunkards, gamesters,
and those that use bad language: for the keeping
of bad company has been the destruction of thousands;
and especially the greatest mischief has
been done among unthinking <i>youth</i>: their inexperience,
and unsuspecting dispositions, making
them the fit subjects for villainy to work upon.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">St. Denis, July 21</span>,<br />
<br />
<i>At half past one</i>, P. M.<br />
</p>

<p>I am now standing in the abbey of St. Denis,
which is about six miles from Paris, and
have been told that all the kings of France, excepting
Lewis XVI. are buried here, and that
the house of Bourbon lie under my feet.&mdash;Alas!
said I, here is the end of those mighty monarchs,
that once ruled the kingdom, commanded armies,
fought battles, obtained victories, collected riches,
and enjoyed the honours, the profits and the pleasures
of this perishing world.&mdash;Here they lie
silent! and their dominion, strength, and power,
are wholly gone!&mdash;Their bodies are returned to
the elements out of which they were formed,
<i>viz.</i> to the earth, air, fire, and water. Alas!
continued I, the present king of France, with all
the mighty kings and princes on the globe, together,
with the rest of the human race, must
soon pass through this change! And not only the
human race, but the birds, beasts and fishes,
trees, plants, and herbs; even every thing that
hath life must be dissolved, and return to the
elements, <i>viz.</i> Earth to earth, air to air, fire to
fire, and water to water; for it is the <i>decree</i> of the
<i>Divine Artificer</i>, who is the former of our bodies,
and the father of our spirits, that all these things
shall <i>once die</i>!&mdash;And, none of the mighty kings,
or learned physicians, can hinder themselves or
others, from experiencing this awful change.</p>

<p>Moreover, I had further contemplations upon
the state of the living and the condition of the
dead. I considered the mutability of our bodies;
that they are continually changing; that they
increase in proportion to the quantity of nutrition
which they receive from meat, drink, the circumambient
air, &amp;c. or, decrease in proportion to
a want of nourishment from those things.</p>

<p>That they are continually flying off by insensible
perspiration and other evacuations, and
would soon come to a dissolution, if not nourished
by the vegetable and animal productions.</p>

<p>That the bodies we had seven years ago, are
totally dissolved by those evacuations; and from
hence we have new flesh, new bones, new skin,
new hair, new nails, &amp;c. formed out of the four
elements.</p>

<p>That the time we have lived, is past and gone;
and, that the time we are to live is not yet come,
so that we only live at the present time.</p>

<p>That death is only a change from this state to
another,&mdash;as our bodies return again to the elements,
and our spirits to Him that gave them:
that the dead, being at rest, are totally free from
the cares, troubles, and vexations of a mortal
life. The king is not afraid of losing his kingdom,
nor the beggar of perishing with hunger.</p>

<p>I beg leave to conclude this chapter with the
following reflections, which will not, I hope,
detract from their solemnity, because cast in a
<i>poetical</i> mould.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><i>Of the Curiosities in the Abbey of St. Denis.&mdash;The</i>
<span class="smcap">Doctor</span> <i>views the King's Treasure.&mdash;Goes to
the Italian Theatre.&mdash;Observations on the Actors,
&amp;c.</i></p></div>


<p>Whilst I was at the abbey of St. Denis,
I viewed many elegant statues and paintings,
and the font, or baptismal bason, out of
which the kings of France had been christened.
Afterwards I was admitted by a monk into the
king's treasure, where I saw the crowns of the
kings and queens of France, with many golden
vessels and splendid ornaments.</p>

<p>I dined at a hotel in St. Denis, and returned
to Paris; but in my rout I ascended a hill which
commands a sight of the city, and affords a fine
prospect. On this hill there is a great number of
wind-mills, dwelling-houses, and other buildings.
In the evening I went to the Italian theatre, where
I was very well entertained with performances of
different kinds. Their artificial thunder and
lightning, was alarming; as the claps were very
loud and sudden, and the flashes appeared as natural
as those from the clouds.</p>

<p>The theatres in Paris are very large. They are
opened at five o'clock, and the performances begin
at six, and end at nine,&mdash;which is much better
then to keep people till almost midnight; because
they have time to return to their dwellings in season.</p>

<p>I have often thought that the actors are deficient
in one thing; that is, in their not apprising the
spectators of the subject before the play begins;
and whether it is to be a tragedy or a comedy,
and who or what it is to be in imitation of; and
whether it is to represent a battle, a duel, or a
courtship, &amp;c. for the entering upon these things
without any previous notice, is like a divine's
preaching without naming his text, or letting
his auditors know what subject he is about to
discourse upon.</p>

<p>It is true, indeed, that the actors often send
forth publications, to let the people know what is
to be represented such and such evenings; but
I do not think that more than one person in
twenty that attends the plays ever reads the publications;
and those that do, are put to the
trouble of carrying them to the theatres, and of
tracing them through the evening, or they will
not know before-hand what play is to be acted
next.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Paris, July 22.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This morning I went to Cherenton, which
is two leagues from Paris, and viewed a
great number of skeletons, not only of human
bodies, but of birds, beasts, and fishes; and I
must join in opinion with the Spanish physician,
<i>viz</i>. that they exceed every thing of the kind
in the world, or at least that I ever saw or heard
of. Here are skeletons of infants and adults,
mounted upon the skeletons of horses, of different
sizes; some with the bones only, and some
with the veins and arteries, muscles, &amp;c. In short
every part of the human machine is exposed to
the view of the spectator. The various parts of
the body are also preserved in spirits, and anatomy
is demonstrated in all its branches in the best
manner; which must be of excellent use to young
students.</p>

<p>As I was returning to Paris, I viewed a number
of vineyards which are cultivated for the
purpose of raising grapes. The vines in general
were planted about two feet apart, and are hoed
much like the maze, or Indian corn, in America.
In some places they have rows of potatoes between
the vines, but at such places they are planted
more than two feet apart; and for want of
knowledge in philosophy, many hill their potatoes
too high, which hinders their growth, by obstructing
the rays of the sun from heating their
roots.</p>

<p>The vines run upon poles, that are about four
or five feet high; and after the grapes are gathered
in the fall, the vines are cut down close to the
ground, and from the roots another set arises,
which bear grapes the next year. It appears to
me that such vines would grow in many parts of
America, if they were properly cultivated.</p>

<p>On entering into Paris, I passed by the place
where the Bastille stood; and, behold! a number
of the priests, with a great multitude of people,
had met together to pray for the souls of
them that had been slain, when the Bastille was
taken on the 14th of July, 1789. I was told, that
this was the first time that the priests and the
people had met to pray on that occasion since
the battle happened.</p>

<p>The catholics have various forms of prayer,
which they make use of when they pray for the
dead. The one for brethren, relations, and benefactors,
runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O God, the giver of pardon, and lover of
the salvation of man, we beseech thy clemency
in behalf of our brethren, relations, and benefactors,
who departed this life; that by the intercession
of the Blessed Virgin <i>Mary</i>, and of
all thy saints, thou wouldest receive them into
the joys of thy eternal kingdom: through our
Lord Jesus Christ, <i>Amen</i>."</p></div>

<p>At the end of each form, the following is used:
"Eternal rest give to them, O Lord; and let
perpetual light shine upon them."</p>

<p>After I had left the place where the people were
praying, I walked through the king's physical
gardens, where there are about seven thousand
different kinds of vegetables, consisting of trees,
plants and herbs, collected from the four quarters
of the globe, that can possibly be made to grow
in Paris. I have been informed, that this botanical
garden, and a museum of natural curiosities,
which may be seen every Wednesday and Friday
in the afternoon, costs the king 72,000 livres
<i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>In these gardens there is a mount, which I ascended
by a path that runs round it, in a spiratic
course. At the top of this hill I had a fine prospect,
not only of the gardens, but of the city.</p>

<p>I observed as I passed through the gardens, that
the vegetables were distinguished from one another
by Latin inscriptions, as <i>calamus</i> <i>aromaticus</i>,
<i>sambucus</i>, <i>rhabarbarum</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>A Description of</i> Paris.&mdash;<i>Of the River</i> Seine.&mdash;<i>Of
the Climate.&mdash;Dress,&mdash;Anecdote of a Frenchman.&mdash;French
Courtship, and the Fondness of the Ladies</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>


<p>Paris, the capital of France, is situated in
lat. 48 deg. 50 min. north; and long. 2
deg. 10 min. east of the royal observatory at
Greenwich; and is called one of the grandest and
most beautiful cities in Europe. It is built in a
circular form, and was about eighteen miles in
circumference, 'till of late it has been made
much larger by the augmentation of their buildings,
and the erection of a new wall, which encompasses
the old one at a great distance. The
city is walled in to prevent smuggling, sentries
being placed at the gates, where duties are paid,
&amp;c. The houses in this city are from six to eight
stories high in general, built chiefly of hewn
stone, which are of a lightish colour. These stories
are much higher than ours in London. The
buildings are very magnificent; and the city is
amazingly populous.</p>

<p>It contains upwards of 22,000 houses,&mdash;979
streets,&mdash;52 parishes,&mdash;130 convents,&mdash;28 hospitals,&mdash;and
about 800,000 people.</p>

<p>The streets of this city are narrow; and being
paved to the sides of the houses, with stones much
like those in the middle of the streets in London,
makes the walking inconvenient, and exposes
travellers to the danger of being hurt by the carriages.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the streets of Paris, and many
other cities, had not been laid out at right angles,
at proper distances, and at convenient breadths,
when the places were first built.</p>

<p>Paris is divided almost into equal parts by the
river Seine, which did not appear to me to be so
large as the river Thames. There is a number of
bridges over the Seine, and several of them have
buildings on either side, which form a complete
street. This river rises in Burgundy, and running
through Paris, empties itself into the English
Channel, between Havre-de-Grace and Honfleur.</p>

<p>The tides are not strong enough to bring heavy
vessels up to Paris. The people are obliged to
make use of long barges, and to tow them up with
horses. There are some water-mills erected on
this river, for the purpose of grinding grain, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The air is much clearer at Paris than it is at
London; and the country is healthy: the climate
in the south of France is called the wholesomest
in Europe. It is something remarkable
that I did not see one funeral all the time I was
in France; which made me suppose that they
buried their dead in the night: but this, on enquiry,
I found not to be the practice.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Paris are polite, gay and luxurious;
many of them very handsome. The
amusements of the city are pleasing, and the people
enjoy their pleasures at a cheap rate, as foreigners
contribute much towards the support of
their theatres, hotels, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The people in France do not seem to be much
given to intemperance; and I was told, that when
the farmers and mechanics have received their
wages, they spend them at home in their families,
instead of being drunk at ale-houses; a thing too
common in England. I was also told, that the
French do not use so much corrupt and abominable
language as the English and Irish do.</p>

<p>The ladies have a much handsomer head dress
than the English; they do not wear stays, neither
do they make many of their gowns so long as to
draw on the ground, which is a waste, and a dirty
indecent fashion. The gentlemen dress much
as we do in London, only they sometimes wear
cloaks, and the collars of their coats are not
quite so high as ours. I have sometimes wondered
that cloaks are not more in fashion in
London.</p>

<p>The French are very merry and cheerful; and
their light and airy turn makes them patient in
times of adversity; they have also the just reputation
of being witty; and it has been said, that
they are sometimes too cunning for the English.
This brings to my mind the following anecdote,
<i>viz.</i> A Frenchman, who had supped and lodged
at an inn kept by an Englishman, demanded his
reckoning: the landlord made out a bill of ten
shillings, which the Frenchman paid, thinking in the
mean time that his host was something extravagant
in his demands, and was therefore resolved to be <i>up</i>
with him. The landlord soon complained that he
was very much troubled with rats. "Vell," said
the Frenchman, "for von bouteille of vin, I vill
tell how you may get rid of dem all." The
landlord gave the wine. "Vell," said the Frenchman,
"do you make out a bill, and charge dem
rats ten shillings a-piece for every night da
have lodged in your house, and I vill be bound
da vill all go off, and never trouble you any
more."</p>

<p>I shall here give a slight specimen of the <i>French
courtship</i>, which a gentleman repeated to me;
and if the gentlemen in England, Scotland, Ireland,
America, or elsewhere, shall see fit to follow
the same mode of address to the ladies, I shall
have no objection, providing they address themselves
to proper persons.</p>

<p>
"Madame,<br />
</p>

<p>"Upon the consideration of the good reputation
you bear in the nation, I find an inclination
to offer you my salutation; and, upon my
salvation, if this my declaration finds your acceptation,
it will cause an obligation that will
be of long continuation, even from generation
to generation."</p>

<p>The ladies in France are very amorous, and
those that are married are not much troubled with
their husbands being jealous of them, let them
be honest or dishonest: and you may court a
Frenchman's wife before his face, and he will not
be jealous of you, as I was informed. Great
numbers of the lewd women are said to be licensed
by authority, to keep public houses for the
entertainment of persons of that character.</p>

<p>The disease that is commonly spread by such
people is rather upon the decline at Paris, it is
said; owing to the frequent use of different kinds
of remedies, as preventatives, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Length, Breadth, Boundaries, Inhabitants, New
Divisions, Mountains, Rivers, Soil, Produce, Manufactories,
Commerce, Religion, and Laws of</i> France.</p></div>


<p>The kingdom of France is about six hundred
and twenty-two miles in length from north
to south, and six hundred and twenty in breadth
from east to west: It is bounded&mdash;Easterly on Germany,
Switzerland, Savoy, and Piedmont&mdash;Southerly
on the Mediterranean sea, and the Pyrenean
mountains, which separate it from Spain&mdash;Westerly
on the Bay of Biscay&mdash;Northerly on the
English channel&mdash;and North-easterly on the Spanish
Netherlands. It contains near 26,950<sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> square
leagues&mdash;25,000,000 of inhabitants&mdash;Eighteen
arch-bishoprics&mdash;167,000 clergymen&mdash;28 universities&mdash;25
academies&mdash;750 great convents of
monks&mdash;200 of nuns&mdash;10,000 of a smaller
kind&mdash;and upwards of 200,000 of monks and
nuns.</p>

<p>I understand that the National Assembly have
divided the kingdom into eighty grand divisions,
or counties, of eighteen leagues in length, and
as many in breadth; and each grand division into
nine commonalities, that are six leagues square;
and also each commonality into nine cantons, of
two leagues in length, and two in breadth.</p>

<p>Hence there are eighty grand divisions, seven
hundred and twenty commonalities, and 6480
cantons in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The mountains in France are, the Alps&mdash;the
Pyrenees&mdash;the Vague&mdash;Mount Jura&mdash;the Convennes&mdash;and
Mount Dor.</p>

<p>The chief rivers are, the Rhone&mdash;the Garoune&mdash;the
Loire&mdash;the Seine&mdash;the Somme&mdash;and the
Ardour.</p>

<p>The climate is mild and healthy, as has already
been observed; and the soil fruitful, though not
equal to Great Britain for corn: but their fruits
are more numerous, and of a higher flavour than
ours, by reason of their growing in a more
southern country. They have the largest plumbs
I ever saw: but their beans, peas, and strawberries
were small. In the northern provinces they
have good cider and perry; and in the southern
the best of wines. In the province of Languedoc
they raise silk and olive oil.</p>

<p>France does not abound in coal, which obliges
the people to raise and burn wood, and sometimes
turf. There are many excellent forests between
Paris and Calais, and some beds of turf. In Paris
they have the largest magazines of wood that I
ever saw.</p>

<p>The animals in France are of the same kinds of
those in England; only they have some wolves, as
I was informed.</p>

<p>The French manufacture silks, woollens, velvets,
brocades, alamodes, lawns, laces, cambrics, tapestry,
glass, hardware, war-like implements, paper,
hats, thread, toys, &amp;c. but I do not think their
manufacturies are equal to those of England in
all respects.</p>

<p>France carries on the greatest foreign trade of
any kingdom in the world, except Great Britain;
and the inland trade is very large, by the way of
their navigable rivers, canals, &amp;c. One of the
latter is said to be one hundred miles in length,
and opens a communication between the ocean
and the Mediterranean; it is carried over mountains
and vallies, and through one mountain. It
was begun and finished in the reign of Lewis
XIV. It is called the Royal Canal, or Canal of
Languedoc.</p>

<p>The established religion of France is that of the
Roman Catholicks; but of late the Protestants have
been allowed a toleration.</p>

<p>I was told at Paris that many of the people look
upon the Romish clergy as impostors, and that they
had found them out, and intend to pull them
down.</p>

<p>It was said that a few of the laws of France were
very arbitrary and tyrannical before the late Revolution,
as they were totally inconsistent with the laws
of humanity; among which was that for confiscating
the property of foreigners dying in France, and
appropriating it to the use of the state. But since
my arrival at Paris the National Assembly have
abolished for ever that unreasonable decree. Had
I died whilst I was in that kingdom, and before
the decree was abolished, my hat, shirts, coats,
waistcoats, breeches, stockings, shoes, buckles,
books, trunk, money, diploma, recommendations,
&amp;c. would have been confiscated and taken from
my heirs; and for no other crime than that of my
going to see the country, and do business for myself
in Paris!</p>

<p>How unreasonable was it, that the heirs of the
deceased, <i>viz.</i> the poor widows and the fatherless
children, should have their property alienated in
such a manner! Surely such a transaction must
be disgraceful, not only to Christendom, but even
to the most barbarous nations!</p>

<p>I was told that the National Assembly had also
abolished, for ever, two other decrees, which they
deemed unreasonable. They were those that debarred
the clergy from the liberty of entering into
the bands of matrimony, and certain females the
same privilege; and also, for the keeping them in
confinement all the days of their lives in nunneries.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution the laws were executed
with the utmost severity.</p>

<p>A servant would be hung for stealing less then
a shilling. Murderers and high-way robbers, and
those that attempted to poison any body, were
broke on the wheel.</p>

<p>Smugglers were condemned to be gally-slaves
for life.</p>

<p>Women brought to bed with dead bastard
children, without having made known their pregnancy,
were burnt alive.</p>

<p>Priests that revealed the confessions of penitents,
had their tongues tore out, their gowns stripped off,
and were expelled from their employments.</p>

<p>He that robbed a church had his hands cut off
at the church door, and was afterwards burnt at
the place of execution, which was always in the
centre of the town.</p>

<p>People of family, convicted of a capital offence,
though not executed, are disennobled, with all
their relations, turned out of their public employments,
and rendered incapable of holding any
afterwards, and all marriage contracts become
void.</p>

<p>The nobility and clergy, with the burgesses of
Paris, and some other free cities, were exempted
from paying land taxes.</p>

<p>Having, partly from my own knowledge,
and partly from credible information,
given in the preceding chapter a short geographical
description of the kingdom of France, I
proceed, in the next place, to say something concerning
its Constitution and Government before
the late Revolution.</p>

<p>Let us therefore observe,</p>

<p>1. That France was an unlimited monarchy.</p>

<p>2. That both the legislative and executive
powers resided in the king.</p>

<p>3. That his decrees had the same force as our
acts of parliament.</p>

<p>4. That the kingdom was divided into fifteen
parts, each of which had a parliament; as that of
Paris, Toulouse, Rouen, Grenoble, Bordeaux,
Dijon, Aix, Rennes, Pau, Besancon, Metz, Dowa,
Perpignan, Arras, and Alsace.</p>

<p>5. That these parliaments consisted of a certain
number of presidents and inferior judges, who purchased
their offices of the crown, or of those that
possessed them, as they were for life, unless the
officers were found guilty of malconduct in the
execution of their office.</p>

<p>6. That the parliament of Paris was esteemed
the highest, because it was composed of princes of
royal blood, dukes and peers, besides ordinary
judges. Here the king frequently came in person,
and had his royal edicts recorded and promulgated.</p>

<p>7. That the kingdom was also divided into
twenty-five generalities, every one of which had
an intendant, on whom the king depended for the
administration of justice, in civil and criminal
causes; for ruling and governing the subordinate
officers, and ordering and conducting his finances
and revenues.</p>

<p>8. That the king nominated the bishops and
their livings, and then the pope sent his bulls of
consecration.</p>

<p>9. That the crown seized all the temporalities
of archbishopricks, and bishopricks, which
was called the <i>regal</i>, and the king frequently gave
pensions to laymen out of the bishopricks.</p>

<p>The privileges of the clergy were:</p>

<p>1. An exemption from paying land-taxes.</p>

<p>2. From having their books seized, with the
other things they used in divine service.</p>

<p>3. They might be tried in criminal causes, if
they chose it, before the grand chamber, which is
a court where the nobility were tried.</p>

<p>4. They had the liberty of being degraded, or
placed lower, before they could be executed for
any atrocious crime.</p>

<p>5. They were exempt from having soldiers
quartered on them.</p>

<p>6. Their persons could not be taken with executions
in civil actions.</p>

<p>7. They were exempted from being brought
before lay courts for personal matters:</p>

<p>But they could not bring a layman before an
ecclesiastical court.</p>

<p>All spiritual actions were recognizable in the
ecclesiastical courts, providing they were not
blended with temporal matters; and when that
was the case, they were obliged to try their causes
before the civil courts.</p>

<p>There have been four orders of knighthood in
France:</p>



<div class="center">

<p>The annual revenues were collected by a land-tax&mdash;by
the customs&mdash;by a tax on salt&mdash;by a poll-tax&mdash;by
a tenth of estates and employments&mdash;by a
sale of all offices of justice&mdash;and by a tenth, or free
gift of the clergy. But this revenue was subject to
an enlargment, by raising the value of the coin,
and by the compounding of the state bills and
debentures.</p>

<p>The annual revenue of France, before the Revolution,
was said to be 585,000,000 of livres, or
24,375,000 pounds sterling. Of which sum the
clergy possessed 130,000,000 of livres. The annual

<p><i>The Constitution of</i> France <i>changed from Monarchy
to Democracy.&mdash;The Number and Power of the
National Assembly.&mdash;The King is only an executive
Officer.&mdash;A Decree of the National Assembly.&mdash;Titles
of Nobility abolished.</i></p></div>


<p>Having in the preceding chapter given an
account of the constitution and government
of France before the Revolution, let us consider, in
the next place, of the present constitution and
government of that kingdom.</p>

<p>We must therefore observe:</p>


<p>1. That the constitution is changed from monarchy
to democracy; that the legislative powers
are taken from the king, and vested in the people.</p>

<p>2. That the kingdom is divided into eighty
grand divisions, and subdivided into seven hundred
and twenty commonalities and 6480 cantons.</p>

<p>3. That each commonality is empowered to
send one representative to the National Assembly.</p>

<p>4. That the National Assembly is composed of
seven hundred and twenty members, when the
whole are convened.</p>

<p>5. That this assembly is the supreme legislative
head of the nation.</p>

<p>6. That the power of making laws, raising of
taxes, the coining, borrowing, and lending of
money; the setting up and pulling down of officers,
granting of commissions and employments; the
making of war and peace; and the entering into
treaties and alliances with foreign powers, belongs
to this assembly only.</p>

<p>7. That the king is only an executive officer,
as he is to see the laws of the representatives of
the nation executed.</p>

<p>The king is to execute the actual decrees of the
National Assembly, respecting war and peace; and
is allowed to provide for the safety of the realm,
in case of a foreign invasion, during the recess of
the assembly.</p>

<p>A decree of the National Assembly, passed in
May last, runs thus:</p>

<p>"The king shall have the right to provide for
the security of the frontiers, to make every preparation,
and take every necessary step to defend
the national possessions; to manage the operations
of the war, and to propose whatever he thinks
proper for the general good:</p>

<p>"But the legislative body shall have the right
to decide on the propriety of the war, make
peace, and settle treaties.</p>

<p>"In case of war, the king shall give immediate
notice of it to the legislative body, if the assembly
is sitting, and if not, it shall be summoned
immediately."</p>

<p>I was informed in Paris, that the National Assembly
have abolished all the titles of nobility; and
observed that their coats of arms were taken from
their carriages.</p>

<p>It was also reported, that the nobility are to pay
land and other taxes, in proportion to their
abilities.</p>

<p>These are some of the fundamental alterations
in the Constitution, according to the best information
that I have been able to obtain. Let us then,
in the next chapter, consider of the causes of the
Revolution.</p>

<p><i>Supposed Causes of the Revolution.&mdash;The Resolutions
of the National Assembly.&mdash;Names of some of the
Officers appointed under the New Constitution.</i></p></div>


<p>It is said that the Revolution arose from various
causes: as,</p>

<p>1. The people had no part of the power of
legislation.</p>

<p>2. They were deprived of the right of a trial
by jury.</p>

<p>3. They paid more than their proportion of the
public taxes, because the nobility, clergy, &amp;c.
were exempted from paying a land-tax.</p>

<p>4. They were under some laws peculiarly
oppressive.</p>

<p>Their grievances will appear by the following
resolutions, which on the 4th of August, 1789,
the National Assembly unanimously agreed to, as
a proof of their genuine patriotism to the people,
as their affectionate and disinterested representatives,
devoid of every motive but the common
good; and, to give a great example to nations and
ages, in the sacrifice of every abusive right and
privilege whatsoever, incidental to all the orders,
provinces, cities and communities, will raise the
French name to a heighth unparalleled in history,
and consecrate their memory as worthy of representing
the enlightened knowledge, the courage,
and the virtues of so great and generous a people.</p>

<p>"Article I. An equality of taxes, to commence
from the present moment.</p>

<p>"II. The renunciation of all privileges for
orders, cities, provinces, and individuals; a general
uniformity to take place through the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>"III. The redemption of all feudal rights.</p>

<p>"IV. A suppression of mortmain and personal
servitude.</p>

<p>"V. The produce of the redemption of the
estates of the clergy to be applied to the augmentation
of the salaries of the parish priests.</p>

<p>"VI. The abolition of the game laws, <i>capitaineries</i>.</p>

<p>"VII. The abolition of seigniorial jurisdictions.</p>

<p>"VIII. The abolition of the venality of
officers.</p>

<p>"IX. Justice to be rendered gratuitously to
the people.</p>

<p>"X. The abolition of privileged dove-coats
and warrens, (a dreadful and serious grievance to
the French peasant).</p>

<p>"XI. The redemption of tithes and field-rents.</p>

<p>"XII. It is forbidden to create in future any
rights of the same nature, or any other feudal
rights whatever.</p>

<p>"XIII. The abolition of the fees of parish
priests, for births, marriages, or deaths, except in
the cities.</p>

<p>"XIV. A speedy augmentation of the benefices
of parish priests.</p>

<p>"XV. A suppression of the <i>droits d'annates</i>, or

on this head, ammounted annually to 357,133<i>l.</i>

<p>"XVI. The admission of all ranks of citizens
to civil and military employments.</p>

<p>"XVII. The suppression of the duties of removal,

<p>"XIX. The suppression of the plurality of

<p>"XX. A medal to be struck to consecrate this

<p>"XXI. <i>Te Deum</i> to be sung in the king's
chapel, and throughout all France.</p>

<p>"XXII. Louis XVI. proclaimed the restorer of

<p>There were several other articles, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>The abolition of all unmerited pensions.</p>

<p>All artizens to be exempt from taxes, who
employ no journeymen.</p>

<p>All suits for seignioral and royal rights, then
pending in the courts, to be suspended till the constitution
shall be completed.</p>

<p>All the interior councils were suppressed; and
the cabinet were composed of the following ministers,
who were responsible for every measure of
state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A Declaration of the Rights which have been adopted
by the National Assembly.&mdash;Reductions made from
the Annual Revenues.&mdash;Two Banks established.&mdash;Criminals
may employ Counsel, &amp;c.</i></p></div>


<p>"The representatives of the people of France,
constituted in national assembly, considering
that ignorance, forgetfulness, or neglect of the
rights of man, are the sole causes of public misfortunes,
and of the corruption of governments,
have resolved to explain, in a solemn declaration,
the natural imprescriptible, inalienable, and sacred
rights of man; to the end that this declaration,
being constantly presented to all the members of
society, may unceasingly recal to their minds their
duties and their rights; and to the end that the
acts of legislative and executive powers, being at all
times compared with the design of the political institution,
may be more respected, and that the
appeals of the citizens, being founded henceforward
on plain and incontestible principles, may
always tend to the maintenance of the constitution
and the general happiness.</p>

<p>"The National Assembly, in consequence, recognizes
and declares in the presence, and under the
auspices of the Supreme Being, the sacred rights
of the man and the citizen.</p>

<p>"I. Men are born and remain free and equal
in their rights. No distinction can be founded,
but in principles of general utility.</p>

<p>"II. The object of all society ought to be the
preservation of the natural and imprescriptible
rights of man. These rights are his liberty, his
property, his security, and the resistance of oppression.</p>

<p>"III. The principle of all sovereignty resides
essentially in the nation; and no authority, which
is not expressly derived from thence, can be exercised
by any associations, or any individual.</p>

<p>"IV. Liberty consists in the power of doing
every thing which does not injure another person:
Thus the exercise of the natural rights of every
man, have no other boundaries, than those which
assure to men the free exercise of the same rights.
These boundaries cannot be determined by law.</p>

<p>"V. The law ought to prohibit only such
actions as are injurious to society. That which is
not forbidden by the law, should not be prevented;
and no person can be compelled to do what the
law does not ordain.</p>

<p>"VI. The law is the expression of the general
will; and all citizens have a right to contribute,
either personally, or by their representatives, to
its formation. The law, whether it protects or
punishes, ought to be the same to all. All citizens
being equal in its regard, are equally admissible to
all dignities, places, and employments, according
to their capacities, without any other distinction
than what arises from their virtues and their
talents.</p>

<p>"VII. No man can be accused, arrested, or
retained, but in the case determined by the law,
and under the forms which it has prescribed.
Those who solicit, forward, execute, or cause to
be punished. Every citizen called on or arrested
by the power of the law, ought to obey, and renders
himself culpable by resistance.</p>

<p>"VIII. The law should establish no punishments
but what are strictly and evidently necessary; and
no person can be punished but by the power of the
law established; promulgated at a period anterior
to the offence, and legally applied.</p>

<p>"IX. Every man shall be presumed innocent
until he is condemned. If it be deemed indispensibly
necessary that he should be detained in custody,
all rigour that is not absolutely necessary to
secure his person, should be severely repressed by
law.</p>

<p>"X. No person shall be disturbed for his opinions,
even though on religion, provided that the
manifestation of those opinions does not disturb
the public order established by law.</p>

<p>"XI. The free communication of thoughts and
opinions is one of the most precious rights of man.
Every citizen shall, therefore, speak, write, and
print his opinions freely, still being responsible for
the abuse of his liberty, in cases prescribed by
the law.</p>

<p>"XII. The security of the rights of man and
of citizens requires a public force; but this force
is instituted for the advantage of all, and not for
the particular use of those to whom it is confided.</p>

<p>"XIII. For the maintenance of the public force,
and the other expences of government, contribution
is necessary; but this should be as common
as it is indispensible, and should be levied equally
on all citizens, in proportion to their ability.</p>

<p>"XIV. Every citizen has a right, either by himself
or his representatives, to establish the necessity
of the public contribution, to consent to it freely,
to look to its application, and to determine on its
quota, the assessment, and duration.</p>

<p>"XV. Society has a right to demand from
every public agent an account of his administration.</p>

<p>"XVI. Every society, if the guarantee of the
individual rights is not assured, and the distinction
of the several powers ascertained, is without a
constitution.</p>

<p>"XVII. The right of property being inviolable
and secured, no person can be deprived of his, but
when the public necessity, legally established, shall
evidently demand it, and then only on the just and
previous assurance of indemnification."</p>

<p>It appears by the information I received in
France, and a number of publications that I
have read, that there have been divers tumults and
outrages in different parts of the kingdom, in
consequence of the Revolution: for besides the
taking of the Bastille, where more than three
hundred were slain, exclusive of those that were
afterwards executed, hostilities have commenced
in other places. It has been said, they first began
in the park of the <i>Thuilleries</i>, by a regiment of
German troops, commanded by Le Prince Lambache,
who is cousin to the queen. This park
being thronged by Parisians, and the prince conceiving
something that had passed among the
people as a gross insult, ordered his regiment to
fire:&mdash;His orders were obeyed. The populace
immediately beat to arms, and a vast concourse
joined the standard, drove the prince and his regiment
out of the park, and obliged them to fly to
Germany. The prince narrowly escaped with his
life. His carriage was burnt to ashes, his horses
killed, and a reward was offered for his head.
How many were slain in this action I have not been
able to learn.</p>

<p>The people have been much enraged against Le
Compte de Artois, and have supposed that he was
the author of their wrongs. His estate has been
confiscated, and his horses, with three hundred of
his houses, sold. It was thought at Paris, that he
cannot return at present with safety.</p>

<p>Some time in the spring, 1789, a proprietor to
a large manufactory in Paris, reported that fifteen
sous per day would be sufficient to support a journeyman
and his family, providing certain taxes
were abolished. His house was soon surrounded
by the manufacturers, who came in a very hostile
manner. The guards were sent to preserve the
peace. But the enraged multitude killed several
of the soldiers with stones. The military was
drawn forth, and a battle ensued, in which more
then six hundred persons were killed on the spot.</p>

<p>At St. Germin and Poissy, the populace seized all
the arms belonging to the invalids; and upwards of
six hundred went to the house of one Sauvage,
where they found between six and seven hundred
sacks of flour. He was a miller, and it is probable
they supposed he meant to hoard up his flour.
He was dragged to a convent, was examined by
the friars, and declared innocent: but notwithstanding,
the mob led him to a butcher, who cut
off his head; and carried it about the streets; and
they were so inhuman as to insist upon the miller's
sons being present at the execution. His daughter,
unable to bear the sight, threw herself over the
bridge, into the water, and was drowned.</p>

<p>Dreadful were the outrages committed at Rouen:
Many of the citizens were killed by the troops,
and some suffered greatly by the populace, who
ransacked and pillaged all the houses where they
suspected corn was concealed. Two vessels were
stripped, and all sorts of carriages attacked and
robbed.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July, 1789, an insurrection happened
at Lions, wherein three peasants were killed
by the dragoons, who suppressed the mob.</p>

<p>At the castle of Quinsay, as an immense crowd
of citizens and soldiers were amusing themselves
with festivity and dancing, on account of the Revolution,
they were blown up by a powder plot, and
found floating in their blood. Scattered corpses,
and dissevered members, palpitating for life, were
seen, after some spectators had arrived, near the
place where the horrible catastrophe happened.
This plot was supposed to be laid by the very man
who had prepared the feast, and had invited the
people, but had withdrawn himself before the powder
took fire.</p>

<p>On the 5th of Oct. 1789, 5,000 women, armed
with different weapons, marched from Paris to Versailles,
followed by a great multitude of people,
among which were several detachments of the city
militia. The Marquis de la Fayette arrived at Versailles
late in the evening, with 20,000 corps, who
were under arms all night, in order to prevent acts
of violence.</p>

<p>About two in the morning of the 6th, a number
of persons in women's dresses, many of whom, it
is said, were guards, having gained the outward
entrances of the castle, forced their way into the
palace, and went up the stair-case leading to the
queen's apartment, with an intent to seize and
murder her; but they were fired upon by the
king's guard. Seventeen were killed on the spot,
the rest retreated, and things remained quiet till
day-light.</p>

<p>The Parisian troops demanding an entrance into
the palace, were fired upon by a regiment of the
king's body guard. The Parisians returned the
fire; and the action becoming more general, the
Count de Lusignan, commandant of a regiment
of Flanders, ordered his troops to fire, but they refused,
and laid down their arms. The king's body
guard finding themselves overpowered, took to
flight. The troops then forced the entrances of
the castle, but were prevented from entering the
palace by the prudent management and command
of M. de la Fayette. It is thought that the king,
queen, and royal family, would have fallen victims
to the troops, had they entered the palace.</p>

<p>The Marquis was soon introduced to the king,
with some of the magistrates of Paris, and communicated
the desire of the city, that he might conduct
his majesty and the royal family thither. On
being assured of protection, the king complied
with the request; and their majesties, with the dauphin,
&amp;c. the king's aunts, with their attendants,
proceeded toward town in eighteen carriages, attended
by M. de la Fayette, and about 5,000
guards.</p>

<p>The road from Versailles was so thronged by the
mob, notwithstanding 50,000 Parisian troops had
been sent to keep the way clear, that the royal
family were eight hours in reaching the <i>Hotel de
Ville</i>, though only twelve miles distance.</p>

<p>This tedious journey must have been rendered
the more painful, by the thoughts of being led captives
in triumph to the city of Paris, and the fear of
what might follow.</p>

<p>The king, with the royal family, stayed near two
hours at the <i>Hotel de Ville</i>, and were afterwards
conducted to the old ruinous place of the <i>Thuilleries</i>,
which had not been inhabited since the
days of Lewis XIV. and where nothing was prepared
for their reception.</p>

<p>The regiment of the king's body guards, both
officers and privates, were composed of persons of
the second order of nobility in France. About
thirty of them were killed, and their heads carried
in triumph to Paris, and shewn about the streets
on tent poles. Eighty were carried prisoners to
this city; but the rest saved themselves by flight.
About fifty of the Parisian troops and mob were
killed in the affray.</p>

<p>On the 7th, the avenues of the <i>Thuilleries</i> were
guarded by 1000 men, and the gates of the palace
were secured by a train of cannon, to prevent any
surprize or escape.</p>

<p>This day being court day, their majesties received
the foreign ministers in the palace. The king
looked uncommonly dejected; the queen was in
tears the whole time, and only talked a little to the
imperial ambassador. The sight was uncommonly
gloomy, and the court broke up after a short
time.</p>

<p>In the evening the districts of Paris passed a resolution,
that the regiment of the king's body
guard should be immediately broken, and never
more revived; and that in future his majesty should
be guarded by citizens instead of soldiers.</p>

<p>This evening the National Assembly at Versailles
resolved to adjourn to Paris; and that its meeting
should ever be inseparable from the king's place
of residence.</p>

<p>Just before the affray at Versailles, several riots
had commenced at Paris.</p>

<p>It is said, that whilst the king, queen, &amp;c. were
on their journey from Versailles, nothing but the
watchful eye of the Marquis de la Fayette, and the
confidential guards around the royal coaches, prevented
the mob from committing the most violent
outrages. The queen's name was handed about
in very gross terms: One barbarian asked his companion,
"Whether he thought her head would
not make a very pretty tennis-ball?" In short,
her majesty must be in the most imminent danger.</p>

<p>The harmless spectators were in a dangerous
condition at this tumultuous scene. An English
gentleman, dressed in white clothes, on a riotous
day, was seized by a mob, when one cried out,
"That is the miller of&mdash;&mdash;, who secreted so
many bags of flour:" He told them he was an
Englishman, and was innocent: but all was in
vain: they insisted he was the man; and he was
so much affrighted that he spake nothing but
French.</p>

<p>They dragged him to the place of execution, he
protesting all the way that he was an Englishman:
at last one of the mob cried out, "D&mdash;&mdash;n you, if
you are an Englishman, speak <i>English</i>." He then
spake in his own language, and was released.</p>

<p>Besides these insurrections, I understand that
two happened in May last: one was at Montpellier,
and the other at Saumur, where several lives were
lost.</p>

<p>I was told in Paris, that the king would have
lost his kingdom, if he had not been a wise and
prudent man; that had he opposed the National
Assembly, he would have been no longer king.
And it was reported that the representatives of the
nation, are able to raise an army of seventeen
hundred thousand men, in the defence of liberty.</p>

<p>His most Christian Majesty, Lewis XVI.
king of France and Navarre, was born
August 23, 1753. He was married May 16,
1770; to Marie Antoinette, sister to the late
Emperor of Germany. The king began to reign,
May 10, 1774; and was crowned June 11, 1775.
He is of a middling stature, something corpulent,
and of a light complexion. His majesty is good
humoured, very humane, kind, and affable; and as
he is easy of access, and possesses the most amiable
virtues, he is much beloved by his people.</p>

<p>The queen was born November 2, 1755. She
is very handsome, and of a civil, mild, complaisant,
and obliging deportment. And although
the public clamour was violent againt her for a
time, on a supposition that she wished the king absolute;
yet I was informed, that the spirit of discontent
has subsided.</p>

<p>Madame la princesse royal is about thirteen years
of age. She is very handsome, and possesses excellent
accomplishments.</p>

<p>The dauphin is about seven years old: an active,
beautiful child.</p>

the Revolution is called Glorious.&mdash;The Protest of a Bishop.&mdash;Observations
on the King's Oath.</i></p></div>


<p>It is said, that some of the nobility and clergy
are much opposed to the Revolution, because the
titles of honour are abolished, the annual incomes
diminished, and all are obliged to pay taxes in
proportion to their abilities.</p>

<p>I was informed, that the salaries of the bishops
are reduced from twenty-five thousand pounds
<i>per annum</i>, to one thousand; only that some of
them could not live with twenty-five thousand,
without running in debt, and that they are now in
a disagreeable situation.</p>

<p>It was reported that the National Assembly have
given leave to the monks and nuns to marry, a
privilege that people of those orders have been
debarred from through many ages and generations.
I asked, what must be done on account of the
solemn vows by which they had devoted themselves
to Heaven, by engaging to shun the pomps and
vanities of this wicked world, and the sinful lusts
of the flesh? and was informed that they were all
absolved and abolished.</p>

<p>The standing army is to be reduced from two
hundred to one hundred and fifty thousand: but
the soldiers' wages have been augmented: and
although the incomes of the bishops are greatly
reduced, yet those of the inferior orders of the
clergy are to be increased; and the sale of judicial
offices will no longer be permitted. The impost
on salt is also abolished.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution the king had the disposal
of the whole of the national revenue; and with
unbounded generosity gave 1,500,000 pounds annually
to the nobility, as I was informed.</p>

<p>Some call the Revolution in France <i>Glorious</i>,</p>

<p>1. Because (they say) that no Revolution ever
conferred <i>liberty</i> and <i>equal laws</i> upon so great a
number of people.</p>

<p>2. Because it has been brought about with so
little effusion of blood.</p>

<p>3. Because they suppose that other nations will
follow the laudable example, until liberty, in its
meridian splendor, is extended and established
through the world!</p>

<p>It is said, that the prince bishop of Spiers has
again solemnly protested against the proceedings
of the National Assembly, in choosing mayors,
and municipal members in the towns and places
of Elsas, belonging to his bishopric, and other
innovations against his rights and privileges. In
this important protest he says, "That he had laid
before the king, in the most earnest manner, his
opposition to the decrees of the National Assembly;
which decrees had absolutely overset all
the existing treaties with France: that he had
delivered a memorial to the emperor and to the
realm upon this important subject; notwithstanding
which they had proceeded to the appointment
of new municipal officers in Elsas,
according to the decrees of the National Assembly,
and against his right of jurisdiction and
appointment; that the new mayors committed
great outrages, and set his subjects against paying
him any dues, and were endeavouring to
make them throw off his dominion:" and he
concludes by saying, "that his powers leave him
no other remedy than to <i>protest</i> against what
is done, which he does in the most solemn
manner."</p>

<p>A spirit of discontent will undoubtedly reign for
a time among some of those that have had their
incomes diminished in consequence of the Resolution.</p>

<p>Agreeable to the bishop's opinion, in regard to
the existing treaties, &amp;c. being overset, is the following
paragraph, inserted in the St. James's
Chronicle, July 24, 1790.</p>

<p>"The king of France has now bound himself
by a sacred oath, to adhere to the decrees of
the National Assembly, and support the constitution
in its renovated form; consequently
there is an end to all foreign interferences on
his behalf, either in Spain, Sardinia, or any
other quarter. To countenance such an interference
would be an act of perjury, and justify
his subjects in such measures as might be fatal
to himself and the whole house of Bourbon.
His majesty may be deemed unfortunate; but
no prince ranks higher in the estimation of mankind,
as an honest and conscientious man."</p>

<p>The National Assembly have decreed to
strengthen, by a treaty, the family compact
between France and Spain, and to augment the
Gallic navy in consequence of the armaments of
the different nations in Europe.</p>

<span class="smcap">Paris, July 23</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>Having viewed the greatest hospitals and
principal curiosities in this city, and the
parts adjacent, and obtained an account of the late
observations on the operation of medicines, and
collected intelligence upon political subjects, I
paid my reckoning at the hotel, bid the people
farewel, and set off for London. My landlady
sent a servant after me, praying that I would put
up there again when I came to Paris. I returned
her my thanks, and told the servant that I would
endeavour to come there if I should ever visit the
city again.</p>

<p>Some days before I had engaged a passage
back to London, on board the diligences, for
which I paid five <i>Louis d'ors</i>. My servant who
had waited upon me, seemed urgent I should take
him to England, having an inclination to live with
me; which I should have done, had I not determined
to spend much of my time in travelling.</p>

<p>I left Paris about noon, in company with two
Spanish, one French, one Irish, and two English
gentlemen: one of the latter was a lawyer, who
had travelled through many countries on the
European continent.</p>

<p>I inquired where we should dine; and was informed
that we were to have no dinner that day,
unless we payed for it ourselves, although we
were to be found on the way, according to the
agreement we had made when we paid for our
fare, entertainment, &amp;c. at Paris.</p>

<p>As we had no inclination to starve, we stopped
at a hotel, where we dined and paid for our dinners
a second time.</p>

<p>At evening we came to Clermont, where we
supped and lodged, but was called up before day-light,
to proceed on our journey. At this place a
lady came into our coach, who had come in a post-chaise
on the preceding day from Paris.</p>


<p>
<span class="smcap">July 24.</span><br />
</p>

<p>At about twelve we came to Amiens, having
breakfasted by the way. We put up at a hotel,
where the lady that came in company with us, said
she had an inclination to go and see the convent.
Several of us waited upon her to the convent; but
just after we had set out, she said she had so much
silver with her that she could not walk; and desired
I would ease her of a part of her burthen. I
took a large number of her crowns into my pocket,
and she walked betwixt the lawyer and myself.
After we had viewed the convent, and conversed
with the nuns, we went to a very elegant cathedral
church at Notre Dame, where some of the inside
pillars are said to be one hundred and thirty feet
high. The pulpit is made of beautiful white
marble, gilt with gold, and the cloths of the altar
are ornamented with beautiful gold and silver embroidery:
many rich vessels, and other splendid
ornaments also dignify this cathedral.</p>

<p>Afterwards we viewed the town, in which are
eleven parish churches. Amiens is the capital of
the province of Picardie, which is esteemed the
most fruitful of all the provinces in France, for
corn and flax. As we continued our walk, our
company took a wrong street, and left me with
the lady. Now, forsooth, said I to myself, we
shall be taken for <i>man</i> and <i>wife</i>; however, that
will not trouble me, inasmuch as she is a decent
behaved person, and one that appears to have an
excellent education, with a proper share of good
sense and understanding.</p>

<p>She told me by the way that she belonged to
Great Britain, but had had her education in a
convent in France: That she had been a widow
about three years, was left with four children, <i>viz.</i>
with two sons and two daughters, and had been
to Paris to get her daughters into a convent, as
she esteemed such places to be the best for the instruction
of young persons.</p>

<p>I told her that as she was but young herself, it
was probable she would marry again; but she said
that she did not intend to marry. Said I, Perhaps
you will alter your mind, peradventure you may
find an agreeable companion. Said she, If I should
be inclined to marry, nobody will have me, because
I have so many children. My answer was, You
ought not to be despised because you have children.
Undoubtedly many would be glad to
marry you, though you have sons and daughters.
As we had arrived at the hotel, we dropped our
discourse upon this subject; I returned her silver,
and she thanked me for my kindness. She was a
beautiful woman, and was besides well stocked
with cash, which often <i>makes the mare to go</i>. But
as I was not in pursuit of a wife, I did not attempt
to court her on my own account; but told her,
however, that I believed I could send her an agreeable
companion.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Saturday, July 24.</span><br />
</p>

<p>We dined at the hotel, and set off towards
London. Sometime before night, our
lady told me, that she was almost beat out; that
she had had but a little sleep for several nights, and
intended to lodge at Abbeville, and go from
thence in a post-chaise in the morning to Calais;
as she supposed that she could get there as soon
that way, as she should if she kept in the stage
coach, which was to travel all night. She told
me, by the way, that she had no company, and
wished she could get somebody to ride in the post-chaise
with her. I informed her, that I had paid
for my passage and entertainment to London:
but if she could do no better, I would tarry all
night, and ride with her in the morning. She
thanked me, and said, it should cost me nothing;
for <i>she had money enough</i>.</p>

<p>Now, thought I, you are opening a fine door
for another discourse upon matrimony; now you
are laying a foundation whereby we may be taken
for man and wife. This may be an artful plan of
yours to get another husband, as you may suppose
I am a batchelor, or a widower; and that
we may converse, eat, drink, and even sleep together,
and escape undiscovered.</p>

<p>She said she was in a great hurry to get to
England; that she had tarried longer than she had
expected, and wanted to see her family, as she
supposed they thought she was dead by that time:
and withal informed me that she lived forty miles
from London. But I did not ask her name, thinking
it would be an impertinent question, and
esteemed unpolite.</p>

<p>At length we arrived at Abbeville, where we
supped; and as our lady found she could not have
a post-chaise till the next Monday, and as she felt
much refreshed by her supper, she concluded to
take the stage again. We travelled all night, and
arrived in the morning at Montreul, where we
viewed the town and went to breakfast.</p>

<p>This town is situated on a high hill, and is
strongly fortified with great walls, intrenchments,
&amp;c. There are some good buildings in it, and
many genteel inhabitants.</p>

<p>From Montreul we went to Boulogn, where
we were obliged to dine at too early an hour, <i>viz.</i>
at about eleven. Many of us had an inclination
not to dine at all; but on being informed that
there would be no other dinner for us, we consented.
We left this place about twelve, and arrived
at Calais at about four in the afternoon,
much fatigued with our journey.</p>

<p>As we had rode all night, we escaped being
haunted by the beggars, which I have spoken of in
the beginning of this <i>Tour</i>; and from hence it
did not cost me quite so much to come from Paris
as it did to go there.</p>

<p>We drank tea and supped at the hotel in Calais,
and were visited again by the same monk or priest,
who had begged of me at the hotel before. We
gave him some money, and he pronounced a
blessing, and departed.</p>

<p>As the tide was down, we were not able to set
off for Dover till late in the evening. At about
nine we were obliged to go down near the vessel,
and tarry till it was high-water, because we had
to pass through several gates that the people were
ordered to shut at that hour.</p>

<p>We stayed at a public-house, where we drank
punch, negus, &amp;c. and at about eleven we embarked
for Dover, and arrived at our desired
haven about four the next morning, having had
a very pleasant and agreeable passage. But as it
was low water when we came to Dover, we
were obliged to go ashore in a boat, and to pay
three shillings a-piece to the boatman for carrying
us about half a mile.</p>

<p>Whilst I was on the way to and from Paris,
we had some warm debates upon several philosophical
subjects, <i>viz.</i> Chymestry, electricity, the
cause of earthquakes, the variation of the compass;
the formation, preservation, and dissolution of the
human body, &amp;c. and, although I do not take
much delight in arguments, but have rather endeavoured
to shun and avoid them as much as possible;
yet inasmuch as I had begun upon a good
basis, and found myself violently opposed, I stood
my ground, supported and maintained my cause,
and at last had the satisfaction of seeing my opponents
convinced of their error.</p>

<span class="smcap">July 26.</span><br />
</p>

<p>When we had arrived at Dover we breakfasted
at the hotel, where the captain of
the vessel, the steward, porters, &amp;c. came and
begged of us. We gave the captain half a crown
a-piece, and something to the rest of the beggars;
but were now obliged to get our French money
changed for English, and to lose considerably by
the exchange.</p>

<p>Afterwards we walked upon the High-lands at
Dover, and viewed the castle and the town: and
when the tide was up, our vessel arrived with our
baggage: our trunks were searched at the Custom-house,
and one in our company, who had brought
a number of prints from Paris, had them seized,
because they were prohibited goods. A thing he
said he did not know till they were taken from
him. He told me they were worth about thirty
pounds.</p>

<p>When our business was done at the Custom-house,
we returned to the hotel, where our lady,
the lawyer, and one of the merchants, set off in a
post-chaise for London, because they had not paid
their fare any further than to Calais, and could
travel faster in the chaise than they could in the
diligences. I told the lady before we parted,
that I intended to give the public a narration of
my journey. She prayed I would let her have
one, and promised to call on me when she came
to London.</p>

<p>The two Spanish gentlemen, a Frenchman, and
two other gentlemen, with myself, left Dover
about noon, and dined at Canterbury, where we
viewed the abbey, which is a very ancient and elegant
building: A part of it has been built eleven
hundred years. We were there in the time of
divine worship. They chanted the service, and
their vocal and instrumental music was very excellent:
The former bishops of Canterbury are
buried here, and there are many statues and paintings
in commemoration of ancient kings, bishops,
and generals.</p>

<p>Before we left the hotel we were obliged to
pay for the wine we had drank.</p>

<p>At about ten in the evening we came to Rochester,
where we called for supper: but were informed
that if we had one we must pay for a part
of it, as the money was all exhausted that we had
paid for our passages and entertainment, excepting
five shillings. We had a supper, and paid an extravagent
price for it, but were careful to have the
five shillings deducted.</p>

<p>After we had supped, we pursued our journey,
and arrived at the White Bear Inn, Piccadilly,
about five the next morning, greatly fatigued; as
we had been but about eighty-nine hours upon
our journey, which is nineteen hours short of the
time commonly allowed for the performance thereof.
I had not been in bed for three nights, only
I lay down a few minutes on a mattress when we
were crossing the English Channel.</p>

<p>I do not think that the owners of the diligences
can afford to carry people to and from Paris for
a less sum than what they demand, nor to give
better entertainment than such as we received, as
it is a great distance, and half a guinea is given,
out of five for the conveyance of a passenger over
the English Channel: but people ought to know
how they are to fare before they set off to France;
and for that reason I have been more minute in
many circumstances, than at first sight might
appear to some to be necessary.</p>

some deprive themselves of that Right by their own
Conduct, and some by the Conduct of others.&mdash;Of
the Duty of Nations.&mdash;The evil Effects of bad Constitutions.&mdash;Of
the French Revolution.&mdash;The happy
Condition of the British Empire.</i></p></div>


<p>As liberty consists in the free exercise of our
religion, the enjoyment of our rights, and
the profits of our labour, with the protection of
our persons and properties, it is a privilege of an
immense value. And as it is the natural right of
every man, it is our indespensible duty to seek
after it, whenever we are deprived of its benefits.
But we find that many deprive themselves of liberty
by their own evil conduct&mdash;by breaking the good
and wholesome laws of the land, by doing things
dishonourable to the Creator, and injurious to
mankind. Thus thieves, robbers, murderers, &amp;c.
destroy their own freedom by their vicious behaviour;
and expose themselves, not only to confinement,
but to more severe punishments.</p>

<p>We also find, that many are deprived of liberty
by the inhuman conduct of tyrants, who oppress and
persecute those over whom they have usurped dominion
and power, by taking from them the liberty
of conscience, and loading them with burthens
which they are unable to bear.</p>

<p>It is the duty of every nation to guard against
all these evils; and from hence arises the necessity
of having a good constitution and system of laws
in every kingdom or state; binding upon all ranks,
orders, and degrees of men. Hence also arises
the necessity of having kings, counsellors, governors,
magistrates, and other officers appointed for
the administration of justice, and the preservation
of public tranquillity.</p>

<p>Various constitutions and systems of laws have
been framed and established amongst different nations;
and where ignorance and superstition have
reigned triumphant, the constitution and laws have
been very deficient, so that things have been established
and practised that were repugnant to the
principles of justice and humanity. What numerous
multitudes have been massacred for a difference
of opinion in matters of religion and modes of worship!
And how many thousands have worn out
their days in vassalage and slavery, because laws
have been made contrary to the requisitions of
the great law of reason! But whenever the minds
of the people are illuminated, and the clouds of
darkness, ignorance and superstition are dispelled,
the spirit of liberty breaks forth like the sun in its
meridian splendor. The constitutions are altered,
oppressive laws abolished, the bands of tyranny and
oppression are broken asunder, distressed objects
are discharged from confinement, the liberal and
mechanical arts and sciences thrive and flourish,
and all enjoy those liberties which are the natural
right of every man.</p>

<p>The illumination of the minds of the people in
France, has been productive of the great and glorious
Revolution; of the forming of a new constitution,
the enacting of new laws, and the abolishing
of those things that were repugnant to the interest
and prosperity of the kingdom. How pleasing
must it be to see both the King and the National
Assembly unite together in establishing the
new constitution, and in promoting whatever may
conduce to the good of the nation, and benefit of
mankind in general! May the flame of liberty,
like the refulgent beams of the sun, be extended
over the face of the whole globe; and may all
nations partake of the great and glorious blessings
of natural freedom!</p>

<p>And with pleasure we recollect, that once in
the <i>British Empire</i>, the inhabitants, fired with the
love of liberty, drove ignorance, darkness, and
superstition before them; made a glorious stand
for their rights, and were thereby brought into a
happy situation. We are now blest with a good
king, with good rulers, and with a good constitution
and system of laws.&mdash;Here a man enjoys a
free toleration of religion.&mdash;Here he is rewarded
for his labour.&mdash;Here he is protected in his person
and property.&mdash;Here agriculture, navigation, trade,
commerce, architecture, and the manufactories
thrive and flourish; and the nation has arrived to
an inconceivable pitch of grandeur and affluence.
Our constitution, being pregnant with a variety
of privileges, is admired by distant nations:
foreigners come from afar, and find shelter and
protection, liberty and freedom, under our government!</p>

<p class="ph4">THE GREAT<br />

<big>CONSTITUTION</big><br />

OF<br />

<big>LIBERTY,</big></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Founded upon the Principles of Justice,<br />
and the Laws of Humanity</span>.
</p>


<p>Every constitution and system of laws ought
to be constructed upon the principles of
justice and humanity, which will ensure the rights
of a king, and the peace, liberty, and happiness
of his subjects. I shall therefore beg leave to observe:</p>

<p>1. That every man has a legal right to perform
religious worship according to the dictates of his
conscience, at such times and places as shall be most
agreeable to himself; providing he doth not injure
others in their persons, characters, or properties.</p>

<p>2. That it is unlawful to persecute any of the
human race, for a difference of opinion in matters
of religion or modes of worship.</p>

<p>3. That public teachers are needful to instruct
people in the principles of religion and morality.</p>

<p>4. That good rulers, both in church and state,
ought to be reasonably rewarded for their services,
out of the public funds; and impowered
to remove officers for malconduct; and, by and
with the advice and consent of the body corporate,
to expel members for vicious practices.</p>

<p>5. That the freedom of speech, and the liberty
of the press, are the natural rights of every man,
providing he doth not injure himself nor others
by his conversation, or publications.</p>

<p>6. That legislative and executive officers, consisting
of kings, counsellors, governors, judges,
magistrates, representatives, and other rulers, are
necessary to make and execute laws for the preservation
of the public tranquillity in empires, kingdoms,
and states.</p>

<p>7. That it is unlawful for rulers to make and
execute laws repugnant to those of the great <i>Governor</i>
of the universe, or destructive to the peace
and prosperity of the community at large.</p>

<p>8. That the people have a right to chuse and
send delegates, to represent their state and condition
in a legislative assembly.</p>

<p>9. That a legislative body ought to consist of
a mixture of monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical
governments, and be divided into three
branches, as that of a king, lords, and commons.</p>

<p>10. That each branch ought to have a negative
voice on the other branches; and no bill ought to
be passed into a law without the advice and consent
of, at least, two-thirds of the members of two
of the branches of the legislature.</p>

<p>11. That legislators ought to meet once in a
year, and as much oftener as the circumstances of
the nation may require, at such times and places
as may be most convenient.</p>

<p>12. That the people have a right to petition
the legislature for a redress of grievances.</p>

<p>13. That every branch of an empire ought
to be subject to the supreme legislative head of a
nation: To render all proper honour and obedience
to the king, and to all in authority, and to be
subordinate to the good and wholesome laws of
the land.</p>

<p>14. That a king ought to be considered as the
first supreme legislative and executive officer in a
kingdom, and to be empowered to grant pardons
to criminals whenever it may be needful. He has
a right to a free liberty of conscience; to protection
in his person, character, and property; to rule and
govern his people according to the constitution,
statutes, laws and ordinances of his realm; to that
honour and obedience that is due to personages in
such an exalted station; and to such a revenue as
his circumstances may require, and his subjects be
able to raise.</p>

<p>15. That no man ought to be chosen into
office, unless he is endowed with wisdom and
knowledge, and can be well recommended for
good works and pious actions.</p>

<p>16. That it is lawful to confer titles of honour
upon, and to give rewards to such persons as may
merit them, by their vigorous exertions and good
conduct.</p>

<p>17. That legislators ought to be exempted from
being arrested for debt, whilst they are passing to,
remain at, and are returning from the legislative
assemblies, because an arrestment would impede
the public service.</p>

<p>18. That courts of justice ought to be established,
and justice administered to all, without respect
of persons.</p>

<p>19. That every man ought to be allowed a
trial by jury.</p>

<p>20. That those under confinement ought to
know what they are confined for; who their accusers
are; not be compelled to bear witness against
themselves; be allowed to bring evidence, with
the benefit of counsel; and should not be condemned,
unless found guilty by the testimony of
two or three credible witnesses.</p>

<p>21. That excessive bail ought never to be demanded,
excessive fines required, nor excessive
punishments inflicted.</p>

<p>22. That criminals under confinement, ought to
have no punishment laid upon them, but that
which is requisite for the securing of their bodies;
unless after they have been found guilty, it is
ordered by the judges, agreeable to the laws of the
land.</p>

<p>23. That no man ought to be imprisoned for
debt, providing he gives up his property to his
creditors, and has not waited his time in idleness,
nor his estate by intemperance, gaming, or any
other vicious practice.</p>

<p>24. That persons falsely imprisoned, ought to
be immediately liberated, and to have ample satisfaction
for the injuries they have received; and
those guilty of the abomination of confining the
innocent, ought to be severely punished for their
atrocious conduct.</p>

<p>25. That every one who is a subject of taxation,
ought to be allowed to vote for a representative.</p>

<p>26. That every man ought to be taxed in proportion
to his abilities.</p>

<p>27. That the power of levying and collecting
taxes, duties, imposts, &amp;c. with that of coining
money, emitting bills of credit, borrowing money
for the public use, entering into treaties and alliances
with foreign powers, appointing, commissioning,
and sending of ambassadors, ministers,
consuls, messengers, &amp;c. belongs to the legislature.</p>

<p>28. That such treaties ought to be esteemed as
a part of the law of the land; kept inviolate; and
whenever they are broken, restitution ought to be
made to the party injured.</p>

<p>29. That as money is a defence as well as wisdom,
a circulating medium ought to be established,
consisting of gold, silver, copper, and bills of exchange.
Its credit should be kept up, and but one
currency established in a kingdom.</p>

<p>30. That churches ought to be built for the
accommodation of the people when they perform
religious worship; public schools, colleges, academies,
and universities erected, for the promotion
of literature; hospitals founded for the reception
of the sick; work-houses for the employment of
idle persons; and prisons for the securing of
thieves, robbers, murderers, and other felons;&mdash;and
societies instituted, for the purpose of making
further discoveries and improvements in the liberal
and mechanical arts and sciences.</p>

<p>31. That custom-houses, post-offices, and post-roads,
ought to be established in every kingdom and
state.</p>

<p>32. That weights and measures ought to be
alike in every part of an empire, if not through the
world.</p>

<p>33. That all foreigners ought to be treated
with hospitality, and protected by the laws of
the land.</p>

<p>34. That the heirs of an estate ought not to be
disinherited by reason of the ill conduct of their
parents; nor thrown out of their posts of honour
and profit, in consequence of the unlawful behaviour
of their relations.</p>

<p>35. That every author ought to have the benefit
of his own productions, whether they be upon
theological, mathematical, philosophical, physical,
mechanical, or any other subject.</p>

<p>36. That all officers, whether ecclesiastical, civil,
or military, with every other person, ought to
guard against sedition, treason, rebellion, and every
thing that may tend to sow discord amongst brethren,
destroy the public tranquillity, and make
mankind unhappy.</p>

<p>Thus have I framed a <span class="smcap">CONSTITUTION</span>, which
appears to me to be according to the law of reason,
and the dictates of sound policy. Perhaps
some things have escaped my observation, that
might justly be added. However, I believe that
one calculated and established upon these principles,
would secure the rights of kings and those
of their subjects, which is all that any rational
person can desire.</p>

<p><i>Of the impossibility of framing a Constitution that will
please every Body.&mdash;Anecdote of two Irishmen.&mdash;The
Rights of Kings, and Liberties of their Subjects,
ought to be secured by a good Constitution and
System of Laws.&mdash;Story of the Parson's Wig.&mdash;Thoughts
on the Mode of chusing Representatives.&mdash;The
Happiness of the People ought to be promoted.</i></p></div>


<p>I cannot expect my political sentiments will
please every body, let them be ever so well
founded on reason; for there are such a number
of discontented mortals in the world, who lust
after dominion and power, and such multitudes
that do not wish to be under any government
at all, that should the <i>Angel Gabriel</i> frame and
send a <i>Constitution</i> from <i>Heaven</i>, some would be
found to murmur at it.</p>

<p>Many are of such a craving temper and disposition,
that they would engross the whole world to
themselves, and rule and govern it, were it in
their power. The ambition of some men is almost
boundless.&mdash;This brings to my mind an anecdote
of two Irishmen, who being intoxicated with liquor
at an inn, began to think that they were masters of
the whole globe, and agreed to divide it equally
between themselves: but as the intoxication increased,
one of them, who was of a very craving
disposition, concluded that he had the best right to
the world, and swore that he would have it all to
himself; whilst the other contended, that he was
justly entitled to one half of it, and wanted no more
than his right. At last they settled the matter by a
number of heavy blows; but whether the world was
at last to be equally divided, or whether one was
to have it all, and the other no part of it, I have
forgot, although I had my information from a
gentleman who was witness to this very singular
contest, and knew something of our <i>wise</i> combatants.</p>

<p>The same temper and disposition amongst others,
has prevailed too much in the world; and has
sometimes broke out into such acts of violence,
that kings and nobles have been deprived of their
rights, and oftentimes the people at large of theirs.
A monarch may crave the estates, and all the profits
of the labours of his subjects; and, on the
contrary, the people may crave those things that
legally belong to their king; and, by acts of violence
and injustice, both may lose their rights.
But both of these extremes ought to be carefully
guarded against, and the rights of kings, and
those of their subjects, secured by a <i>good Constitution</i>
and system of laws. Is it not strange that mortal
men, who can abide but a very short time in this
troublesome world, should be so craving as to lust
after more riches, honours and profits, than they
can enjoy, or that can possibly do them any good?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why doth the miser all his cares employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To gain those riches that he can't enjoy?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the powers of legislation are lodged
altogether in one man, and the nobles and other
inhabitants of a country are shut out from having
any voice in the making of laws; or when the
powers are in the nobles, or in the people only,
it will naturally generate a spirit of discontent
amongst those who have not a share in that power.
Will not a king feel very uneasy, if he has no part
of the legislative power? Will not the nobles be
discontented, if they have no part of it? And,
will not the people murmur, if they have no share
in the same? Therefore, to prevent uneasiness,
and promote a spirit of union and harmony in
empires, kingdoms and states, it is best, in my
opinion, to have a mixture of monarchy, aristocracy,
and democracy in every legislative body,
like the parliament of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The things of this world are so mutable, that
we cannot foretel what constitutions may be established
hereafter. And although an astronomer
can determine the revolutions and rotations of
the rambling planets, and point out the directions,
stations, and retrogradations of the luminaries of
heaven, for thousands of years to come; yet he
cannot foretel what will be done hereafter, even
in his own country, or in any other part of the
globe, in regard to the overturning, altering,
framing, and establishing of constitutions, kingdoms,
or states. It is probable that there may be
alterations in these things; and perhaps the future
generations may have a greater knowledge in
politics than the present, and be able to frame better
modes of government than the nations are in this
age: for if the knowledge of philosophy increases
in the world, and the glorious sun-shine of liberty
and freedom breaks forth, the clouds of darkness
and ignorance will be dispelled, atheism, superstition
and idolatry will wear away, and the people
be freed from those burthens and impositions that
involve many, in the dark and benighted corners of
the globe, in vassalage and slavery! It is probable
they will discover that some constitutions have been
deficient, and be able to correct and amend whatever
has been amiss.</p>

<p>But such is the changeableness and discontented
tempers of many, that they would be for ever altering
that which is even good and complete, and so
alter till they spoil it,&mdash;<i>like the minister's wig</i>; an
account of which I will just relate as I received it.</p>

<p>A <i>Reverend Divine</i> having lost his hair in his
old age, bought a large white wig to cover his
naked head; but it displeased his auditors to that
degree that they had a church-meeting on the subject,
and concluded that the wearing of such a large
wig was idolatry, and accordingly sent a committee
to their <i>Reverend Pastor</i>, to acquaint him that his
congregation was much displeased, &amp;c. He told
them that he did not wish to have any uneasiness
about the wig, and if they thought it was too
large they might make it smaller; and delivered it
to the committee, who laid it before the congregation
to have it altered; when one cut off a lock of
hair in one place, and another in another, &amp;c. till
the wig was utterly spoilt. At length they agreed
that it was fit to be seen in the pulpit, whereupon
it was returned to the owner; who said it
could not now be <i>idolatry</i> to wear the wig, for it
had not the <i>likeness</i> of any thing in <i>Heaven</i> or
<i>Earth</i>.&mdash;Just so it is with a constitution that is
constructed in the best manner; it will not suit
every one; and if it is clipped by every discontented
mortal, it will be wholly ruined, <i>like the
Reverend Divine's wig</i>.</p>

<p>There is a vanity that I have seen under the sun,
and have often wondered that it has not been suppressed
in this enlightened age. I mean the unjustifiable
mode of chusing legislators in some parts
of the globe.</p>

<p>When the people are called upon to chuse their
representatives, a number will put up in some
public place, when perhaps not more than one or
two is to be chosen. There scaffolds must be
erected, publications sent forth, mobs convened
day after day, harangues delivered, and many
thousands spent to induce the freeholders to chuse
their delegates&mdash;when the whole of the work
might be completed in half a day, by the people's
assembling at the places appointed for the performance
of religious worship, and carrying in their
votes, in writing, to the clerk of every parish,
who might easily send them to some person that
might be authorised in the county to receive and
count the same, and to promulgate who has the
greatest number, or who the people have chosen
for their legislators. Would not this mode take
up less time, be much easier to the people, and
much more commendable, and beneficial to the
community, than to have the freeholders fatigue
themselves by coming a great distance, wasting their
time by being kept from their employments, day
after day; quarrelling and wrangling about the
choice of a representative? or, than to have the
candidates for such places waste their estates by
keeping open houses, giving away victuals, drink,
ribbands, cockades, &amp;c. till they have ruined
themselves, families, and creditors?</p>

<p>To all people, nations, and languages, that
dwell in all the world.</p>

<p>2. Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied unto
you.</p>

<p>3. It hath seemed good unto me to promulgate
this <i>Epistle</i>, and to make known thereby the
genuine description of the road which leads to
that liberty which is destitute of licentiousness.</p>

<p>4. To mention those things that will make you
comfortable in this life, and conduct you in the
way to everlasting felicity in the realms of immortal
bliss and happiness.</p>

<p>5. I beseech you, therefore, to remember that
atheism, superstition, idolatry, sedition, treason,
rebellion, covetousness, theft, robbery, murder,
intemperance, debauchery, bad language, gaming,
idleness, and all kinds of vice, will carry you out
of the road that leads to liberty, and involve you in
destruction and misery.</p>

<p>6. Shun, therefore, all kinds of vice and immorality,
and walk in the pleasant paths of piety
and virtue, which will establish your freedom on
a parmanent basis.</p>

<p>7. Let those who doubt the existence of a
<i>Supreme Being</i>; and, those who worship the sun,
moon, or stars;&mdash;the birds, beasts, or fishes;&mdash;or
idols made by the hands of men, contemplate upon
the works of the visible creation; which will naturally
convince them of their error, and excite them
to pay homage and adoration to <span class="smcap">Him</span>, who created,
upholds, and governs the universe, and is the only
proper object of religious worship.</p>

<p>8. Avoid contentions, divisions and animosities,
which too frequently terminate in bloodshed and
devaluation.</p>

<p>9. Follow peace with all men; break not your
oaths of allegiance, fulfil your obligations; fear
God, honour the king, and those in authority,
and be subordinate to the good and wholesome
laws of the kingdom or state in which you reside.</p>

<p>10. Walk honestly; render to all their dues;
pay your debts, and your proportion of the public
taxes.</p>

<p>11. Be kind to the poor and needy, relieve the
oppressed, visit the sick, bury the dead, feed the
hungry, clothe the naked; and shew acts of kindness,
charity, and humanity to strangers, captives,
and prisoners.</p>

<p>12. Love yourselves, your families, and your
neighbours; do good to your enemies; avenge
not yourselves.</p>

<p>13. Be not high-minded in prosperity, but patient
in adversity.</p>

<p>14. Cultivate and improve the liberal and mechanical
arts and sciences, and promote every
thing that may tend to make mankind happy.</p>

<p>15. Be careful of your credit, your time, and
your money; shun bad company, use not bad language,
be not idle, waste not your estate in superfluities,
be temperate and exemplary in your lives
and conversations.</p>

<p>16. Shun the pollutions that are in the world,
suppress that which is evil; do as you would be
done by, and continually follow that which is good:
then will ye be in the road that leads to liberty.</p>

<p>17. Grace, mercy, and peace be multiplied unto
you all, <i>Amen</i>.</p>
